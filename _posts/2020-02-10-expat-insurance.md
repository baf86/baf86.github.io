This is episode number 69. And my name is Elise Robinson and I live in Mexico, black woman in Mexico, black American

0:10  
woman in Mexico.

0:12  
Why do I live in Mexico?

0:15  
My mother passed away from blood cancer and I've 11 2016 and I quit my whole life to take care of her in my family. And so at that point, I had nothing left. I'm going to quit a Tam Good job.

0:33  
And, but I did it. I did it for my mother, and I have no regrets, no regrets. And so at that point, I didn't have anything left. All I basically had was my computer and my clothes. And so I decided I was going to go mourn in another country. And that's basically what I did, but I ended up falling in love with

üìÜ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=379678&mid=5759&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2562126&clickref=" target="_blank">TrustedHousesitters</a> - Travel like a local for less. Exchange pet care for free accommodation.</i><br>

Mexico.

1:00  
So I had some Southwest airline points and the cheapest points was to Mexico City. I had never heard of Mexico City I had never even stepped foot in Mexico.

1:11  
lived on the border twice San Diego in Tucson

1:15  
and if you want to count la

1:18  
three times and I never stepped foot in Mexico's everyone's like it's dangerous.

1:21  
You

so I never did. And so you always hear about Puerto Vallarta, Cabo and Cancun. So go check out Mexico City. And so I ended up falling in love with the place and pretty much that was the end of that I'm going into my fourth year here.

1:48  
I classify myself as an immigrant, I'm not expect

1:53  
because I live here permanently,

2:34  
I recently got my one year checkup

2:37  
don't have excuse the noise I don't know what the hell's going on outside of

üé† <i><a href="https://skiplagged.com/r/elyser" target="_blank">Skiplagged</a> - Exposing loopholes in airfare pricing to save you money</i><br>

2:42  
my neighborhood is very quiet very now. I mean, I get some noise sounds like a truck going just going past probably delivering water or something. But got my one year checkup. Actually fast forward that I mean that back better I apologize I've been gone for so long but first of all I was on vacation for like a month in two weeks

3:08  
visiting my family and my friends and having all the fun eating all the bad foods

3:13  
so I had I had fun and froze my

3:16  
ass off most of the time because Houston

3:19  
is the weather is insane it'll be hot one day cold the next

3:25  
almost got caught with cold but I finished it off with some Alka Seltzer and plenty of water and stuff and juices in the berries. So um,

3:36  
but yeah, it almost got me It almost got me good

3:41  
close the nose The guy

3:44  
with Colorado have fun layer my friend and

3:51  
yeah,

3:52  
that's pretty much it. Oh, I went to NASA with my for my other for you. And

‚õÖ <i><a href="https://joinhoney.com/ref/759tu9o" target="_blank">Honey</a> - Find coupons and great deals whenever you shop online</i><br>

3:58  
yeah, that was fun. Doing granite. We got in this. This machine has been around that was that was really fun. Um, but yeah.

4:12  
I just been focusing on getting my business stuff done. Because I mean, I guess that's my job at

4:19  
this point has been entrepreneurs, so I had to pound the pavement like, every day, every day.

4:26  
So that's that

4:31  
back to the health insurance so I said when I came back, I was going to

4:36  
take care of all the stuff I've been procrastinating on here in Mexico like getting my driver's license because I gotta get my driver's license in order to get the Mexican insurance. I don't know what that's about why I can't just set my my regular immigration ID but the lady told me not to get a driver's license. So I gotta go get that done. And it's expensive here.

üõ∏ <i><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/elyser93?currency=USD" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> - Get $40 off a home booking of $75 or more and $15 off an experience of $50 or more</i><br>

4:58  
Sorry about start speaking In Spanish is very expensive here.

5:04  
I think it's a two year license for $50 give or take Mike, are you serious? And here I was complaining about the license fee and how long it is in the States.

5:15  
So I keep my Arizona license because

5:20  
does it expire to 2051? Which I think I'll be 16 thing

5:26  
I guard that thing with my life. Okay. My life I keep it in a drawer it's never on me unless I'm back home in the states drive on or something

üé† <i><a href="https://skiplagged.com/r/elyser" target="_blank">Skiplagged</a> - Exposing loopholes in airfare pricing to save you money</i><br>

5:35  
like no.

5:37  
So I keep that because I ain't about to renew ain't about to had to struggle because I know a lot of expats have struggles with driver's license, but I had to get my driver's license and so I got a health check a while was when I came back, I my blood checked, your in checked all that good stuff and make sure My blood count was good because couple podcasts ago my father thought I was like a real sick, which I kind of was because if you see me now and you sitting back being like I was really skinny and stuff and I did look sick, but I just was the eating the way that my body is supposed to be fade. So I saw a nutritionist I got a podcast on that one. And so I changed my diet with more carbs, more meat.

6:29  
And

6:31  
I'm looking much better I feel so much better because I would literally have to take a nap in the middle of the day.

üöë <i><a href="https://www.sevencorners.com/?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">Seven Corners</a> - Travel/Health insurance in case you get hurt, sick, or lose your luggage</i><br>

6:38  
And I don't have to take naps now.

6:41  
I mean, I've always been an early bird, you know, I'll get up early and go to bed early, but I don't have to I'm not tired in the middle of the day anymore. So shout out to my nutritionist. I need to see her again too. So she can weigh me and everything and I put on weight while I was in the states that good old American food. diet but I admit, when I'm in the states I eat garbage. Okay? I'm eating all the Taco Bell all the McDonald's all the Popeyes. I'm in all a pizza, all of it. Okay, I still eat my fruits and vegetables. I still cook a little bit but now I'm eating out like every day, every day.

7:19  
So

7:21  
I don't know how much I put on but I definitely put on some weight, that's for sure.

7:28  
So yeah.

7:31  
So when I came back, I got the blood checked and everything because I want to see how my blood count was doing. And it's almost normal almost in a normal range. I think it was like point 01 off, so that's good. But my cholesterol went up, so I guess all the meats, got my cholesterol. So I guess there's really no women, you know, you can't just be nice and stable and normal ranges. You got to have something Right.

üõ¥ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=385121&mid=11018&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2598552&clickref=" target="_blank">Viator</a> - Get $10 free</i><br>

8:03  
So yeah, I don't know what to do at this point. I'll bring my results to my nutritionist the way she says.

8:12  
And so that costs me there's a clinic around the corner from me, they do nothing but tests. And so like I said, I got my blood in my urine checked. I do like a 32. panel, cholesterol, blood count,

8:29  
heart function, all that good stuff.

8:32  
And then the urine

‚öì <i><a href="https://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=1953880" target="_blank">Booking.com</a> - Get 20% off hotels</i><br>

8:34  
that costs me $51. And some change according to my Capital One cards. So I don't even want to know how independent tests work, how much that will cost in the States. I don't even want to know probably $300 for all the stuff that I had done. So yeah, so I don't really sat down to figure out how the Mexican insurance works at all where I can go who I can see. So I keep secondary insurance. And that's what I've been using. That way I can go to whoever I want when I want. And and I'll just pay out of pocket and get reimbursed. And so the issue is covering which I put down there in the comments. It's very good knock on wood. They have paid all my clients, I've actually earned money instead of, you know, I've actually gotten all the money that I put out for the for the health insurance. And so this latest policy I got since I grew a year older, the cost went up a couple of dollars, which is how insurance works. Unfortunately, the older you get, the more costly it's going to be.

9:52  
So from

9:52  
I think I got it January 25, to February 29 was $55. I believe it was and some change

ü§ê <i><a href="https://baselang.com/signup/?referral=me%40elyserobinson.com" target="_blank">BaseLang</a> - The website I've been using to learn Spanish with unlimited lessons for $149 per month.</i><br>

9:59  
that excludes

10:02  
deductible. The deductible adds. This attracts a little bit not really anything significant for me at this point, so I get zero deductible. So I exclude the US because I don't go back and forth to the US like I was before. So I exclude that I'll just let y'all taxpayers pay for my healthcare and go to emergency room.

10:26  
They'll be irresponsible.

10:28  
So, um, so that's that.

10:34  
So yeah, what's it gonna say? what I was gonna say?

10:39  
So $55 a month. That'd be what

üíé <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=383744&mid=6288&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2587800&clickref=" target="_blank">Fiverr.com</a> - Need a website? fiverr | Need a voice over? fiverr | Need a logo? fiverr</i><br>

10:42  
cost of $600 roughly a year

10:44  
for if I want to get a 12 year plan.

10:48  
I will quit being lazy and procrastinating in this heat before it really starts getting really hot, and go take care of my damn business like I need to.

10:59  
Thank you. health insurance and my dad was licensing stuff.

11:03  
And so

üìÜ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=379678&mid=5759&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2562126&clickref=" target="_blank">TrustedHousesitters</a> - Travel like a local for less. Exchange pet care for free accommodation.</i><br>

11:04  
I highly recommend them. Like I said, they also have travel insurance in case you lose luggage or your flight is delayed or something like that. So they sell that and then the expat immigrant insurance for people like me that lives overseas.

11:20  
So

11:22  
yeah, and I think it's very, very cost effective I priced

11:25  
other plans,

11:27  
and

11:29  
I couldn't they were going into us prices at that point like three some the month ago. I guess it's

üéñÔ∏è <i><a href="http://www.agentmaxonline.com/agentmaxweb/storefront/index.html#/home/?emaillinkcode=ABIYU4TLWGBGTNHC6ZWLRSKAR7AIBWE33AAW7OYIPBPWYZZAHMNGY4GI3QWHIYSJSFMRKVFBSRHL353RYXNHYWHXUUUWM6LOOV3244I%3d" target="_blank">Allianz</a> - Don't let a canceled flight, stress you out...get travel insurance.</i><br>

11:36  
still cheaper because I mean, they pay for everything. There's I don't think there's any deductible in this expat insurance,

11:41  
you know, when they sell it, so

11:44  
I mean, I guess technically, it's still way better than the shit that you get in the States because the shift again in the states is just laughable. With $6,000 in debt doubles and a 20% coinsurance and whatever else

12:01  
But

12:04  
and I add that I was one of the people

12:09  
that actually audited health plans when Obamacare first rolled out. And so I would look at these health plans and be like,

üî• <i><a href="http://geta.raise.com/erobinson6" target="_blank">Raise</a> - Get $5 and the best place for discounted gift cards</i><br>

12:16  
Damn, like,

12:18  
I don't know how people

12:19  
are here. So five, and I don't know how I'm surviving.

12:21  
And I'll say that

12:25  
every time I would get like, you know, a large savings account, I would get seriously sick.

12:29  
And that's where

12:31  
all my savings will go.

‚õÖ <i><a href="https://joinhoney.com/ref/759tu9o" target="_blank">Honey</a> - Find coupons and great deals whenever you shop online</i><br>

12:35  
Every time but they say the number one reason why people file bankruptcy is

12:38  
his medical bills. So I get it, I get it.

12:44  
And people tell me, you know, asked me all the time and I'm like, I mean, one of the reasons why I can't come back to the states is because of healthcare. Like I'm, I'm too sickly. I'm too sickly to come back to the States.

12:58  
So

13:00  
Not that I've really gotten sick here but in the states that you know, I've had issues you know where, like I said it took all my money.

13:10  
And so not to say that that can happen here

üõ∏ <i><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/elyser93?currency=USD" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> - Get $40 off a home booking of $75 or more and $15 off an experience of $50 or more</i><br>

13:13  
in Mexico or overseas period, but the chances of it happening in I'm being bankrupt or whatever.

13:21  
Slim to kneel. I mean, they literally let you make payments, I've made payments on.

13:28  
I've made payments on massages here they like okay, well, you can pay pay half now. And then in two weeks, you can pay the other half.

13:37  
make payments on the side.

13:40  
I got it going on. So, you know, I don't know what to think of, you know, the situation going on in the States is the smart, the smart home, my first love, but

13:58  
a lot of shit is fucked up. me a lot of shifts fucked up here in Mexico I mean there's things I don't like here of course, but

üé† <i><a href="https://skiplagged.com/r/elyser" target="_blank">Skiplagged</a> - Exposing loopholes in airfare pricing to save you money</i><br>

14:07  
I don't know they make it

14:09  
easier.

14:11  
I don't know maybe possibly more more righteous, maybe the word I'm looking for I don't know.

14:21  
But I've made payments on getting my teeth done

14:24  
which I've done that in the states getting my teeth fixed and in the states I've made payments on that but

14:31  
you can make payments on medical bills in the states too but

14:33  
maybe real quick to turn that ass over to collections

14:36  
real quick.

14:38  
In fucking created it.

14:40  
So I don't know what to say on that.

14:44  
So guys calling me in is probably important, but

14:48  
I'm going to finish my video I decided to call them back at this point.

14:54  
And let me see what else more updates

14:57  
to my life. I have been doing that in this life of We're pounding the pavement.

15:04  
I redesigned my blog. If anyone out there knows about Jekyll and GitHub, I

15:11  
taught myself that so I'm learning that which

15:16  
programming was my first love.

15:18  
I taught myself web design at like, 10 years old, my parents thought I was insane because one summer I sat in the house every day,

15:27  
and was like, I'm gonna learn this shit. Like, that's

15:30  
what was wrong with me. I'm like, I want to go outside and play.

üöë <i><a href="https://www.sevencorners.com/?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">Seven Corners</a> - Travel/Health insurance in case you get hurt, sick, or lose your luggage</i><br>

15:33  
Like, no, I want to learn this.

15:37  
So yes, I'm a geek. I'm a nerd. I'm a weirdo if you want to call me that.

15:42  
But yes, I am self taught at the ripe old age of 10 years old, and has served me well because I don't have to hire anyone to do this stuff. I understand it.

15:54  
And if I don't know something, I research it ask questions. And things are way better now

15:59  
than they were back. When I was 10 years old because there was no, you know, there was no forums, I mean, there's no meetups, you know, because they have meetups here all the time I need to go they have coding meetups just for women here which I love and love.

16:12  
And

16:15  
but I haven't went to one I keep saying I'm gonna go but they'd be early in the morning, which I get because it's so damn hot here but

üõ¥ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=385121&mid=11018&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2598552&clickref=" target="_blank">Viator</a> - Get $10 free</i><br>

16:24  
and you put that on my list of things to do.

16:27  
But anyways, programming was my first love. I was supposed to be a programmer. At one point I even started majoring in computer science. took lots of classes in high school and in college. like half my transcript was probably programming classes, but I probably applied to over 1000 positions and I couldn't get internship to save my life. Now, I don't know if that's because

16:52  
the economy was fucked or

16:57  
the h1 b thing that was going on getting laid off left and

17:01  
right, because foreigners was coming over taking these jobs so they can pay them less. But I wasn't fucking waiting. So I've made using accounting and went that route and it's that has also

17:11  
served me well so I can't complain about that one bit.

17:17  
But I'm back into teaching myself programming,

üóø <i><a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/ee4bce1e-84de-4387-a735-d59d04539960" target="_blank">Groupon</a> - Have used this web site for YEARS to find all kinds of deals in multiple cities all over the world.</i><br>

17:19  
and I love it, I love it, I love it.

17:23  
And I actually apply for a scholarship. And I got I won the scholarship to learn Python, and I haven't even been practicing cuz I've been redesigning my website and out here just doing all kinds of shit. So but other than that

17:44  
I'm gonna get back into programming for sure.

17:49  
But that's,

17:51  
that's my life. And that's what I do at this point is entrepreneur, entrepreneur, entrepreneur.

18:00  
Some business grants. So I'm going to apply to, and wish me luck because I want to win those there in pole doke. So I would probably have to move out there. So I'm back in the states in order to facilitate it and get the money but do anything for

‚öì <i><a href="https://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=1953880" target="_blank">Booking.com</a> - Get 20% off hotels</i><br>

18:19  
my business at this point. So

18:24  
I'm going to apply for that I gotta come up with a business plan. So that should be fun.

18:29  
I gotta buy this software in order to sell

18:31  
because I have no idea what I'm doing to help me with that. I said it's a good software to get.

18:38  
Other than that,

18:40  
oh, the UK scholarship that you want to give me any money, more money. I got a half scholarship for entrepreneurship

ü§ê <i><a href="https://baselang.com/signup/?referral=me%40elyserobinson.com" target="_blank">BaseLang</a> - The website I've been using to learn Spanish with unlimited lessons for $149 per month.</i><br>

18:45  
program in the UK. So I declined that. And so whoever got

18:52  
my scholarship money, thank me

18:55  
because it was supposed to be man But if

19:00  
I don't do anything within the next year or so,

I might move somewhere else

19:07  
and get into a master's degree program and entrepreneurship. So I can,

19:13  
you know, jumpstart this thing a little bit more.

19:18  
So

19:19  
I don't know

19:20  
what my life is looking like at this point.

19:25  
I mean,

19:27  
I don't know.

19:29  
That's what I want to do. I can say that actually do it. I mean,

19:34  
there's certain things in my life that I don't want to leave at this point, but

19:39  
you only live once and certain opportunities, they'll come back around again. So that's what I'm going to do.

19:48  
If the opportunity presents itself,

üìÜ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=379678&mid=5759&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2562126&clickref=" target="_blank">TrustedHousesitters</a> - Travel like a local for less. Exchange pet care for free accommodation.</i><br>

19:51  
I'm

19:53  
trying to think anything else.

19:56  
No, if you if you haven't joined my before Wonder group on Facebook please do

20:03  
check me out on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter like me, follow me. Subscribe on my Youtube channel and to my podcast like this video champion check out my blog at least Robinson calm. It's kind of messy right now. I'm adding posts, my old posts back to it, my old website is gone so if there's any broken links I will hopefully get to them and fix them because now I can actually scan my website and find broken links and things like that. So that should be fun fun. Going to redesign be a foreigner because I don't like how slow it is either.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
