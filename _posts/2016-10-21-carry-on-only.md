Been a few days since I've posted. I've just been getting ready for my next big move, making sure everything is stable with my family or at least as stable as it's going to get while I'm gone for 3 months. I've decided I will no longer carry luggage and I will do carry on only from now on. I've been researching all the things I'll need to be successful.

For my backpack I've settled on a <a href="https://amzn.to/30WaFkw" target="_blank">Tortuga Travel Backpack - 44 Liter Carry-On-Sized, Travel Backpack</a> to carry all my things in. I'm trying to be careful not to over pack so I've made me a list of things I MUST pack. I'll post my final list when I do a practice pack as I'm still getting the things I need.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
