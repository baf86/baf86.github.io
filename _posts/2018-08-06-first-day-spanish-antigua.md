First off...my view outside my bedroom window IS TO DIE FOR! I'll post pics tomorrow as I totally forgot to do it before the sun went down. I have a view of one of the volcanoes. I'm such a mountain girl and could care less about the beach. I have always lived and been surrounded by mountains or volcanoes my whole life minus those years in Boston.

My schedule looks like this from now on:

Rooster crows around 5am
I lay back down hoping to go back to sleep
Officially get up at 630am
Breakfast is at 720am
Class starts at 8am
Break and eat at 1030am
Back to class at 11am
Leave class and lunch at 12pm
Between 12:30-7 I'm studying, working on business stuff, possible nap
Dinner is at 7pm

Got up around 645 to get dressed. I have my own bathroom and room. The shower is lukewarm and this is going to be a struggle when it really starts to get cold. I will go to the supermarket tomorrow and see if I can find a heater, at least my room will be nice and toasty when I get out of the shower.

I'm dressed and ready to eat breakfast. I was served a sandwich (see pic below) with eggs and ham. It was delicious. I think it needed sauce though since Mexicans put some kind of sauce on everything...I felt it was lacking. :lol: I couldn't eat it all and I felt bad later because I left it there and didn't even think to bring it with me to eat later.

My host drove me to the school and dropped me off. I met my teacher named Anna and we walked to the garden where there were a bunch of other students to learn. We dug right into learning Spanish for the next two hours. I took one short break to grab some water and stretch my legs.

A break was at 1030 and there was a family there to serve us food. I grabbed something that looked like an empanada that had chicken in it (see pic below) and got beans on the side. It was delicious. The cost was 3 quetzales, about 40 cents with the exchange rate. I didn't have any money on me so I owe them tomorrow.

Lunch was at 12pm and we had ham, guacamole, and squash (see picture below). It was delicious. Then my host took me to the bank and to get a sim card for my phone. 10gb of data and phone service was about $16 with the exchange rate. I grabbed a pastry that was ok, won't be eating there again. I also paid the restaurant from last night.

I came back home and decided to chill the rest of the day. I just practiced my Spanish and worked on business stuff.

Dinner was at 7pm and we had flautas and mushroom soup. The flautas are different than in Mexico. They had potatoes inside and were made from flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas. I'm going to pass. The soup was delicious though.

That pretty much ends my night. I'm spent but I had fun today. I didn't know I knew so much Spanish it's already coming easier to me when I'm speaking. I'm going to be a Spanish speaking fool in a few weeks!

Stay tuned...

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
