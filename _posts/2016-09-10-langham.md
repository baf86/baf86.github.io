I stayed at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/cn/langham-place-beijing-capital-airport.en.html?aid=1953880&no_rooms=1&group_adults=2">Langham Hotel in Beijing</a> which is right next to the airport when I arrived from my 12 hour flight from San Francisco. It was ridiculously nice and you would never get that in the US for what you pay. Thanks to Expedia I paid $131.76 with a $25.00 off coupon. Regular price was $156.76. I didn't add on the breakfast and definitely should have so instead I paid an extra 193 yuan (about $29) at check in.

There was a person to help me carry my luggage upstairs. I also wigged out about their key card system as I had never seen it before. You stick your card into the wall and it turns everything on. I'm wondering why the guy was asking for my key card and removed it out of the wall. Of course nothing worked in the room until 10 minutes later when I figured out the key card HAS to stay in the wall.

I immediately went to go take a shower after figuring out the room system. The bathroom was simple yet elegant. I did find a stray hair on the bathroom wall though. The shower was nice and hot which is always a good thing. I didn't even think to turn on the TV to see what was showing as I'm not a TV person.

The bed was very comfortable and more so for Chinese standards as their beds are hard as bricks. The internet connection was decent but nothing quick and speedy like back in the US. I tried my hardest to stay up until 9pm China time but made it until 8:30pm and knocked out. Woke back up around 1:30am and didn't go back to sleep. Decided to get up and get dressed to head on the next leg of the trip.

Breakfast was too good. Lots of variety and American foods available. I decided on fruit, hash browns, and a big bowl of noodle soup that you can add whatever you like in it. The soup was delicious. I wish I could have another bowl as we speak.

Overall I give the hotel a 10/10. It was a very pleasant experience.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to México City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of México City nor even visited México before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in México and she is there to stay!
