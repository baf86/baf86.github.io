I'm just waiting on my parents to get here Friday night to make sure they are safe and sound, then I shall be leaving Saturday to Quito, Ecuador! I've been procrastinating on packing my backpack and posting it on here. I decided I will take a box of my essential liquids with me as I can check one bag. My clothes are being washed as I type so I can practice packing what I need. Stay tuned...

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to México City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of México City nor even visited México before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in México and she is there to stay!
