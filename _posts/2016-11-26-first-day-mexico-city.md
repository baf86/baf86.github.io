Arrived at the airport safe and sound. Customs was easy enough...she asked what I was doing there and how long I planned on staying. I told her to learn Spanish at a language school and about 170 days. She let me through with no problems. I had my paperwork in order just in case to include: copy of language school payment, confirmation that I'll be attending starting next week, confirmation of where I'll be staying with AirBnB, and bank statements to show my income. Not even needed...waste of money at UPS lol. Someone's bag also busted on mine so I now I have stained luggage...such is life.

My AirBnB host is wonderful! She sent me an Uber to pick me up and had fruit and nuts waiting for me when I arrived. She showed me the ropes of the apartment and the only thing I don't like is not having heat. It got freaking cold last night! Luckily, I brought thermals and slept in those. She had plenty of blankets on the bed too. I couldn't have picked a better place to live.

So my first day here and of course I need to find food for the night. I took a little rest and decided to head out and try to make it back before dark. The department store is similar to Walmart isn't that far of a walk. I put on Google Maps and walked away. Got to the store and everything is fine. Decided to make grilled cheese sandwiches with a side of sausage for dinner and I could have that for breakfast too. Also picked up a little heater as my apartment has none.

Made my way out the store and turned on Google Maps again to find my way. Got to the street and was looking for the apartment. COULD NOT FIND IT! At this point my phone is about to die and I'm panicking little by little plus I'm tired. I'm asking people on the street do they know where it is and NO ONE KNOWS. Found a taxi driver who took me around looking for it and two little girls too. That was scary lol...as I don't trust folks easily at home nor in a strange place.

I finally found an internet cafe to point out the address to the woman who owns it. She walked around with me and found a Haitian man that spoke English and Spanish to help me. He found his nephew for me and he was kind enough to walk around with me until I found my apartment. I'm SO grateful to him! I added him on my Facebook and offered to take him to dinner. So something positive came out of the situation. Hoping he can show me around and we can be friends to help me learn Spanish too.

So that's my first day in Mexico...didn't even get a chance to take pictures of the area I live in. I shall do that today when I go out with my host.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
