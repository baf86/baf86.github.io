This is my 4th blog post on my <a href="https://elyserobinson.com/grocery-bill-march-28" target="_blank">grocery bill</a>. So people can see how I live, how cheap it is to live here, and because these are easy posts while I work on <a href="http://www.beaforeigner.com" target="_blank">BeAForeigner.com</a>. üòä

This week I'm making pepper steak over rice. <em>#delicioso!</em> ü§§

A picture of the arrachera steak (hanger steak in English) I bought. Does it look different than what you find in your city? üßê

That time of the month is coming so candy.

<strong>Total was $918.73 pesos BUT I received a $313.52 credit so total was $605.21. That's about $31 USD with the exchange rate of about 19 pesos (the exchange rate fluctuates a lot here) = $1 dollar. That includes the service fee, the tip, and any discounts I re</strong>ceived.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
