Spent a few hours researching the cell phone situation in China. From what I researched I could wait until I stepped foot in China and get a sim card at the airport or order one from Ebay or Amazon. I wanted one before I stepped off the plane so I went with a reputable seller by the name of <a href="https://amzn.to/2RjPR2Y">LvyCom</a>. They got a few good reviews so I hope everything works as planned. They also have a "top up" web site that is in English that corresponds to the plan I selected. So it should be easy to refill when the time comes.

The package comes with 2GB of 4G data, 100 mins to US or Canada, 50 minutes of local calls or 100 texts, and free incoming calls and texts and is on the China Unicom network. I heard China Mobile is supposed to be better but I can always switch when I get there and get the hang of how things work. I'm hoping and praying I get a "good" phone number with 4s as digits so I can be "lucky". I chose slow shipping so I could get a credit to Amazon Pantry so I'll review the activation process next week.

I also researched how my family would call me so they wouldn't have to call me long distance. This is where Google Hangouts/Voice comes into play. I have a US number through Google and they can just download the app on their phones/computers to call me anytime for free. I looked into Skype but to get a dedicated number costs money. Google Hangouts/Voice is totally free.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M&eacute;xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M&eacute;xico City nor even visited M&eacute;xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M&eacute;xico and she is there to stay!
