Made it into Beijing yesterday around 3pm. First class was VERY nice and the only way I could fly 12 hours. Having a lie flat bed is a big help as I was well rested and not tired when I arrived.

This time change is going to be the death of me. I fought hard to stay up until 9pm but couldn't make it. I went to sleep at 8:30 and woke back up at midnight. Decided I'd write something so folks don't think I didn't make it.

I'm currently at the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/cn/langham-place-beijing-capital-airport.en.html?aid=1953880&no_rooms=1&group_adults=2" target="_blank">Langham Hotel</a> in Beijing for the night. Then I'll wake up and do it all over again tomorrow to get to Mianyang. I SO overpacked...it was a struggle getting my luggage to the luggage storage area, but I made it! I'm wondering if I can check two bags and go back for the other two later. I'll figure it out...it's what I do best.

The hotel I'm staying in is VERY nice. I'll have to review my flight and hotel when I get settled.

I got pushed on the train and some man I think was trying to scam me to get in his taxi. The airport has designated taxi booths and this man was just standing around in the airport. I read to be weary of the taxi drivers out here as they scam folks.

Just looking at these Chinese letters make me cry but I'll manage I hope.

Beijing seems like a coo city to live in...it doesn't look polluted to me...I don't know if those are lies or what...looks like a normal, major city to me.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
