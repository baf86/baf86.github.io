According to Wikipedia, "Homesickness is the distress or impairment caused by an actual or anticipated separation from home. Its cognitive hallmark is preoccupying thoughts of home and attachment objects. Sufferers typically report a combination of depressive and anxious symptoms, withdrawn behavior and difficulty focusing on topics unrelated to home."

Do I deal with homesickness? Rarely. I've been gone from home almost 7 years and got over it eventually.

The first time I was away from home I was living in the Oakland hills in the Bay area. I went home every weekend. I hated missing a homecooked meal and getting my laundry done. Then I moved to the most depressing place on earth, Boston. That place almost killed me. Between the weather, people, driving, infrastructure, and being away from home it literally almost killed me. I have serious ailments due to living in Boston.

I then got transferred to San Diego where it got a tad bit better but not by much. At least I had SUN and warmth. The day before I flew out it was snowing pretty hard, didn't know if I would make it out. Can you believe it was 10 degrees in Boston when I left and 80 degrees in San Diego when I landed? I almost kissed the ground I was so happy to be back in California!

I lived in downtown San Diego which is not the best part. I would smell and SEE feces and urine on the ground. I would have homeless people pass by my window at night yelling and screaming obscenities. I saw roaches the size of the palm of my hand. I rode the bus and/or train and every time I rode it I had a story to tell. I was called nigger and bitches. I hate San Diego with a passion and vowed never to return.

After that I moved to Los Angeles (Pasadena), if I was rich I would move back in a heartbeat. Los Angeles is where I really started to get over my homesickness. By this time I was 5 years out from moving away from home. Yes it took me 5 years! I loved EVERYTHING  about LA. From the neighborhood I lived in, the people I met, the weather, the fact everything comes to LA first, I rented my first house, I lived down the street from my job and could walk to work, I rode public transportation everywhere and didn't stress off of driving, my city had EVERYTHING you could think of on two main streets, I could go on. I'm about to cry just thinking about all the things I left behind. I left because I got a better job and I got tired of paying outrageous rent. Next, I moved to Tucson, Arizona.

Tucson, Arizona has a special place in my heart. When I was searching for a place to live, all I saw was dirt! Coming from California where greenery is abundant I was shocked. I packed up all my belongs and drove a rental truck to Tucson stopping once in a city right outside of Palm Springs. I was terrified someone would break in and steal everything but I made it. Tucson is definitely not LA but I made the best of it. I was actually surprised they had a lot of my favorite stores and things to do. I went to parties, an ostrich farm, and an observatory. I LOVED waking up to the mountains every morning and oh my! when they were snow topped it was heaven. I remember waking up and watching the sun rise over them as I could see them from my window...I just about had a heart attack it was so beautiful. If it wasn't for that Arizona heat I could have stayed longer.

Of course, I'm in Mexico City, Mexico now and I do get homesick sometimes. It's because I'm in a new country, can't speak the language, and I'm still reeling from my mother's death. I actually go back home more now than I ever did when I lived in the states. It's so cheap to fly back and forth and doesn't take long at all.

Now I wrote all of this to say there are ways to manage your homesickness. A few ways I've overcome it are:

-First things first! NEVER beat yourself up about moving overseas. You moved there for a reason whether it was for  safety, get out of debt, or to gain a new skill. No one said it will be easy or else everyone would do it. Embrace your new life and know there will be challenges. Also realize not everything will be the same as back home. There will be ups and downs.

-Live like a tourist first. Go to all your country's main attractions and get to know the culture and history of your new home. Make a list of must see things and try to check them off one by one.

-Try EVERYTHING in your new country. Ok maybe not everything because there are just some things I refuse to try here. But by doing this you are creating a routine to help you get settled and to get over your fears. Eventually, you'll find your favorite restaurants, parks, and even people.

-Call home, skype/facetime...whatever you need to do to keep in contact with your family and friends. Talk about your issues if you have any and be sure to vent to someone who will listen. This has been crucial for me. I talk to my sister and father every day. Don't over do it though to where it is hindering you from exploring your new country.

üõí <i><a href="http://open.ecwid.com/MStVg" target="_blank">Ecwid</a></i> - Your free online store is just a few clicks away

-Get off of social media and go explore your new country. I'm guilty of this, especially when I get in panic mode and realize I cannot communicate with most people here. I can sit on facebook for hours or watch movies.

-Keep up with the same habits you had back home and create a daily routine. Exercised every day? Continue. Wake up every day and read for an hour? Continue. Collected stamps? Continue. Loved to get a mani/pedi once a month? Continue. I'm also guilty of not doing this but slowly but surely I'm getting back into the routine of what I used to do.

-Try to make your home a home. Pick out things that comfort you in your new space. I had to have my Bose speaker (music), diffuser (stress relief), blender (smoothies), slow cooker (cooking), and resistance bands (exercise).

-Try to get adopted by a family that lives in your country. Make a friend and try to become part of their family. Go to family functions to find out about traditions and the culture of your new home. This is on my to do list sooner rather than later.

-Keep busy. Learn something new such as your new country's language, a dance, sport, or even cooking classes. This will keep you busy and you'll forget all about being homesick.

-Get rid of negative thoughts. Depending on where you are you may stick out and you have to have enough confidence to deal with that. People will stare, people make comments, but it's all apart of the living overseas experience.

-Don't numb the pain if you do get homesick. You do not want to pick up any bad habits such as drinking or drugs overseas or becoming a shopaholic. Stay out the malls! I did go overboard with eating when I first got here. I had to have all my American comforts from back home. So a trip to Olive Garden, Red Lobster, PF Chang (oh I love their plum wine!) was nothing to me. I had to quit that immediately.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
