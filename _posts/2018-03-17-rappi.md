When I say I love this place I really DO! My iPhone cord was acting up and I didn't feel like going out today. I remembered someone here telling me about Rappi. Rappi you can get whatever you want delivered. I said YESSS! I went online and had to figure out what to do but finally figured it out. They have a restaurant, store, and then "whatever you want delivered" section you can choose from.

üëç <a href="https://12vpn.net/?aff=1001" target="_blank">12 VPN</a> - I have been using this virtual private network (VPN) for over 3 years now. Keep your privacy private!

I put in my first order with them and got 80 pesos off my order which is a great deal. My order was dispatched and I was able to communicate with my driver straight from the web site. I told him I needed an iphone charger with the cord. My order was delivered in less than 20 minutes.

Total cost was 100 pesos including a 10 peso tip. So about $5.60.

I give <a href="https://www.rappi.com/" target="_blank">Rappi</a> two thumbs up. Use my code for some free money: 5mo2112378.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
