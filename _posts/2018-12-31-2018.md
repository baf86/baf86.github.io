<div style="font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold">A Reminder...</div>

A reminder that you did well this year! You met new people, learned new things, inhaled and exhaled. You lost count of how many things that made you scared. You dusted yourself off and tried again instead of feeling completely defeated or heartbroken. There may have been some rough days and nights but you survived through all of them. People are happy you are still here, living and breathing. You may have accepted many good byes but the unexpected people you met this year made up for each and every good bye. It was your own hard work that made you successful this year and do not try to downplay what you did or compare yourself to others. You have come so far from the first day of this year. You have way more wisdom and strength on this last day of the year. 2018 was your year of growth and success. Take a moment to be kind to yourself and believe that 2019 will be even greater with more unbelieving achievements and surprises.

<div style="font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold">What were my most memorable moments in 2018?</div>
#1 I become a Permanent Resident of M&eacute;xico! Me encanta M&eacute;xico!<br>
#2 Met a weirdo like me and I enjoy his ass through and through.<br>
#3 Started <a href="http://www.beaforeigner.com" target="_blank">BeAForeigner Inc.</a>, my nonprofit organization, to help youth travel and learn a language and help people move overseas.<br>
#4 Went to Antigua, Guatemala for three months to learn Spanish and had the time of my life.<br>

<em>I'm so excited about what the future holds!</em>

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
