Hey Ya'll! Sorry I've been quiet after Christmas. I've been getting much needed work done...dealing with my parent's stuff, my stuff, working on my future business, plotting, and planning. Guess I was a little depressed too as I threw myself into my work and haven't thought about my mother for a few days. Had a mini break down. I can't wait to see my Dad, sister, and nephew next month. I also get to move into my new apartment and I found out I can bring my dog with me! I've missed his ugly butt so much but he's going to stay with my sister a little longer until I get 100% settled out here.

So going back in time. Saturday I tried to go to the <a href="http://www.mutemgaribaldi.mx/museo.html">Tequila Museum</a> and got denied entry. It clearly says on the ticket I don't have to print it. I should have known...this is Mexico. I'm not pressed to buy a printer until I come back next month. Going back and forth with the two women that were there using Google Translate was a chore. I said the hell with it and went back home. Obviously, it wasn't meant to be. The positive thing is I got a fruit cup and I saw another part of town so not everything was lost.

Funny that everything I have planned here hasn't panned out! I'm going to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucha_libre">Lucha Libre</a> tomorrow so I will write about that when I come back.

I'm looking into private online Spanish lessons. When I start my business I won't have time to go in person or maybe I will who knows but right now online lessons are WAY more efficient or maybe not with my sucky internet connection. I need to message my host and ask him will I have access to the wifi box as I will definitely do ethernet connection with a long cord.

My mission today is to go to Walmart and see what they have there. I want a mattress topper for my bed and I've been procrastinating heavy on that.

For New Year's I have nothing planned right now. Supposed to meet a guy that I met on Facebook for the first time. He's pretty much my only contact out here right now.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
