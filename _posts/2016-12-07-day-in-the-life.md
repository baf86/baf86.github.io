Still trying to get on a schedule. I think I'm doing better today. Recap of yesterday:

Took Uber to my class (I think this will be my mode of transportation to class everyday). Worked on my homework in the car as I was too tired after taking care of business back home to do it. On my way I grabbed a fresh squeezed orange juice from the corner for 15 pesos (75 cents) and it was delicious. Got to where I needed to be and had 20 minutes to grab something to eat and scarf it down before heading to class. I got flauntas which is like taquito back in the states. It was delicious! I got two for $1.25 including tip.

Second day of class and I felt better about it. I love my teacher. He is so great! Yesterday I learned numbers, countries, and recapped how to introduce myself and el alphabetico (the alphabet). I'm so glad I sprung for the 2 hours a day class. 4 hours is too much! I would have been seriously brain dead. 2 hours is just right.

After class my classmate and I went to "linner" and we talked. He's from Scotland and 40 years old. He seems cool. Sorry I didn't take a picture of what I had. It was a delicious tostada. Cost+tip $5 I spent...I don't know how much I tipped I just gave the guy some pesos lol.

After that I went home took care of some business back home and crashed the rest of the night. I was supposed to have a date with my rescuer the Haitian guy but he cancelled on me again...maybe one day lol. Check out the huge pi√±atas I saw. I would love to bring one back for my nephew but I have no idea how that would work on a plane without it getting crushed.

I signed up for a free walking tour of Mexico City this weekend so hopefully I won't be too lazy and go. I need to wash clothes and go shopping.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
