So mi amigo came to visit me and we explored a few spots in Mexico City. We went to a Lucha Libre show (Mexican wrestling), bull fight, and saw the <a href="https://www.myt.org.mx/" target="_blank">Museum of Tolerance</a>. I had so much fun. The bull fight was BRUTAL...worse than the first one I went to. I will post the videos whenever he decides to send them to me. The Museum of Tolerance was very informational and outstanding.

We were on our way to the <a href="http://www.mutemgaribaldi.mx/museo.html" target="_blank">Tequila Museum</a> Monday night. On the crowded train, hot as I don't know what, next thing I know my legs are weak, everything is spinning, and my vision is blurry. Thank goodness I ran off the train. Then I pass out in his arms. It seemed like 5 minutes but he said it was like 1 second. He calls over a few of the security guards and they help me out by fanning me and giving me an apple. Thank goodness I always bring water wherever I go because I needed it.

I‚Äôve had seizures previously thanks to a highly peddled medicine *cough* Zoloft. I won't even get into the discussion on what I've experienced with over 6 different doctors and trying to get help. Basically, I've been laughed out of the room when I told them Zoloft caused me to have seizures. Embarrassed as hell, peed on myself, and almost boo booed üòê. Yeaaaa...

We ended up taking a cab back to his hotel, grabbing some food, and going to sleep.

I'm alright I think but I'll go get established with a doctor next week and find out more about using my Mexican health insurance.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
