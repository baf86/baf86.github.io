Long story short...my father thinks I'm on drugs. My sister showed him a recent pic of me and he burst out crying. üôÑ

I'm sure he probably thinks I'm sick and dying and said drugs instead. Like really Daddy? I moved all the way to Mexico to get on that shit! My mother lost so much weight when she was sick though and you could see every bone in her body...so I understand.

I'm the same weight and height now as my mother when she married my father though...so ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

I noticed too that I've lost quite a bit of weight. I'm back to my high school weight! At 121bs...and I'm about 5'11".

I'm pretty sure when I got to Merida I was about 130lbs or so. This heat is killing me. It makes you go long periods without eating and the sweating doesn't help either burning up all your calories.

I also don't eat a lot of carbs nor meat.

This heat will make you not eat for HOURS because it's just too hot to do anything. And who wants to stand in the kitchen and cook? Not. Me.

Soooo...I have to eat certain foods constantly. As I type this I have eggs boiling and I'm snacking on yogurt. Both fatty foods.

Eggs, cheese, chicken, turkey, tuna, protein powder, oatmeal, whole wheat bread, milk, avocados...the list goes on...

The nutritionist told me I need to put on about 10lbs of muscle and 8 lbs of fat.

Also, I used to exercise HEAVY before my mother got sick. 5-7 days per week with weights so my body was really nice. Of course, I didn't exercise when she became ill. That was 3 years ago...

I notice I have no muscle tone now at all!

So eat good fatty foods and weight training to build muscle.

Today is my first official day of exercising and I feel like Jell-O. üò≠

Here's my before picture...let's see how I look in a month!

The cost was $520 pesos...a fee of 20 pesos for using my debit card. That's about $27 with the exchange rate. A nutritionist in the states is about $150-225 says Google with follow-up appointments being $75-125. From what I remember she said my $27 covered the follow-up appointment too.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
