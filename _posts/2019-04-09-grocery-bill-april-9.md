<strong>At some point, you're going to get tired of living the way you do...</strong> so this is my second blog post on my <a href="https://elyserobinson.com/grocery-bill-march-28" target="_blank">grocery bill</a>. So people can see how I live, how cheap it is to live here, and because these are easy posts while I work on <a href="http://www.beaforeigner.com" target="_blank">BeAForeigner.com</a>. üòä

I usually order groceries once or twice a week to be delivered. This week I made beef tostadas.

A picture of some delicious tostadas that I didn't make ü•≥

Here's my list with prices (in Mexican pesos):
<ul>
	<li>Sour/Sweet Oranges (2) $32.00</li>
	<li>Raspberries (3) $148.50 (yes! they are expensive but I LOVE my berries!)</li>
	<li>Blueberries (3) $146.50 (ditto here)</li>
	<li>Blackberries (3) $134.50 (ditto again)</li>
	<li>Graperfruits (5) $7.50</li>
	<li>Paypaya $40.00</li>
	<li>Aguacate $10.00</li>
	<li>Blueberry Muffin $8.50</li>
	<li>Salsa $8.00</li>
	<li>Can of Jalapenos $16.50</li>
	<li>Cheese Oaxaca $34.00</li>
	<li>Cheese Manchego</li>
	<li>Ground Beef $25.00</li>
	<li>5 Liter Bottles of Water (4) $86.00</li>
	<li>Sour Patch Kids Candy (4) $64.00</li>
</ul>
I didn't tip this time because my order took 5 hours to get and the company just flat out refused to give me a credit. I'm pissed. With discounts my total came to $805.53.

<strong>That's about $42 USD with the exchange rate of about 19 pesos = $1 dollar.</strong>

I'll get another delivery this week because I can't eat tostadas all week or switch to nachos or something üòè.

I was shocked to find that my chocolate chip ice cream was yellow instead of white! <strong>THIS is WHY</strong>: <em>Vanilla ice cream you make yourself is likely to be yellow because of egg yolks. The basic formula for vanilla ice cream is you thicken milk and cream with egg yolks, sweeten them with sugar, flavor them with vanilla, and then freeze them. The yolk will add a yellow color.</em>

So Mexico has the GOOD STUFF!

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
