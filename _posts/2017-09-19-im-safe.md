Up writing late...I just knew Mexico City was going to have another earthquake and that's why I left for Houston almost two weeks ago. My soul told me to LEAVE as soon as possible. This time the earthquake was much, much closer and why there was so much damage. The epicenter of the earthquake was in Puebla which is about 100 miles from Mexico City. There has been no coverage for other areas which I'm sad about but of course, Mexico City is a large city so it will be the focus.

All my peeps are safe which is good and the last I heard about 200 people perished, which is just terrible. There was damage to a building two blocks from my apartment. My landlord says everything is alright with my apartment so we'll see. I'm definitely going back to Mexico City as I LOVE the place and natural disasters happen and there's nothing you can do to stop them. Plus they happen infrequently as the last major earthquake was before I was born in 85. If it's my time to go, then it's my time to go. I weep for both my cities of Houston and Mexico City and hope for a speedy recovery for the people affected.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to MÃ©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of MÃ©xico City nor even visited MÃ©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in MÃ©xico and she is there to stay!
