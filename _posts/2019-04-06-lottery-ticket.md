These last three days have been terrible. Won't go into the first reason why but let's just say I had to kick someone out of my life over a very messy situation. Thought I was dealing with a mature adult but looks can be deceiving...and the way they handled the situation with me in the end left a bad taste in my mouth...as if it was my fault. ü§£ Really need to be coming with...how can I make this up to you or fix this? But nope...too much like right. People are crazy...will turn around and get mad at you and they caused the problem.

Anyhoo...

My computer has been going haywire and my cord decided to die yesterday. It lasted 3 years so I guess I can't complain. Thank goodness Amazon Mexico has them and I receive it on Monday. But I still need to get my computer fixed...I have 3 years to do it. So next time I'm in the states it will be going back to Microsoft. Luckily, I have my mother's MacBook. But I have no idea how to use it and I've been struggling.

My next door neighbor and I have became friends and he's now my Spanish tutor! We're going to teach other...Spanish twice a week and English twice a week. I'm so excited! Free.99 üí∞

My electricity went out today for a while. I don't really know how long because I left for greener pastures. It was 100 today! I got in a taxi and went to Texas Roadhouse (yes they have them here) so I wouldn't die of heat stroke. Had a good meal and a margarita.

I went to my first casino in Mexico. I played 50 pesos and I received 50 free. I didn't win a thing but had fun. I'll be back. They have them in the malls. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Hopped the bus üöå to downtown and explored. Got my first scratcher. I used to see them being sold on the street but didn't know if they were legit in Mexico City so never bought one. I won twice...two new cards, but the third card was for nothing.

Found this little store that has Nance in it. It's alcohol and I had it in Guatemala. It's so good. Worth every penny.

Pissed I couldn't get much work done today because the electricity was out. But today was a good day! I had fun.

I needed ALL OF THAT...

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
