I've been missing in action due to my mother's passing. She passed away the Friday before I was supposed to leave for Ecuador. Her funeral was beautiful and she would have loved it. I want to leave this speech I did for her at her funeral:

<em>Words to describe my mother: silly, intelligent, strong willed, stubborn, giving, loving, talkative I could go on.</em>

<em>My mother loved to talk. It would get so bad I would have to tell my mother to be quiet. She was also so silly she would say some of the most off the wall things. I would say MOMMA NOW. She would just be like you know it's true or I'm just playing. She was so real, honest, and raw about everything no sugar coating anything. I would tell people I could talk to my mother about anything and everything and they would say I could never with my mother. And that's why I loved her she was so open and free and didn't care what others would think about her...she was going to say it anyway and get it off her chest.</em>

<em>No one thought my mother was as sick as she was. I didn't even know until I saw her back in February. My mother always said when she got down and out she didn't want to lose her mind and the Lord granted her her wish. I think that's why people thought she was going to be ok. She had her mind until the end.</em>

<em>I want to talk about why my mother didn't try to fight her blood cancer. My mother had been going to the doctor for years and they were telling her she just had anemia. They told her to wait and see. They told her it was from her period. They tried iron infusions but that didn't work. They diagnosed her with one disease after another but didn't offer a solution. My mother begged for a bone marrow biopsy but when she got her first one the doctor didn't even do it right. By the time she got her second one she was already too weak and frail to do anything. My mother was hopeful to the end as she spoke about changing her diet. She also wanted to make it back to see her baby Chris. She also wanted to see me off before I went to S America but like my momma told me God laughs at your plans.</em>

<em>The Bible says in 1 Peter 4:12 Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. 13 But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed.</em>

<em>Also says in 1 Peter 5:10 And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.</em>

<em>My mother suffered a little while and I hated seeing my mother that way. I'm not sad, mad, or anything else but happy for my mother. She lived a good life and she went home the way the Lord wanted it to be. Sometimes the Lord uses the tragedy of one to bring others to Him. No one suffers in vain. God always has a reason and sometimes He is trying to show someone their need to receive the Lord Jesus Christ.</em>

<em>I always said if I got even half of my mother's mouth and intelligence I'd be set for life. She was an amazing woman and they don't make them like her anymore. And last but not least I want to shout to the world that I wouldn't trade my mother and father in for anything on Earth.</em>

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to México City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of México City nor even visited México before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in México and she is there to stay!
