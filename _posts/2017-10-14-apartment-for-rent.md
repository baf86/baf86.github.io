It was such a nice day today (now it's raining). Walked around and got Lil Ugly and me some exercise and explored my neighborhood some more. Got invited to a new restaurant that opened and he said I could bring mi perro. Might have to go check it out. Trying to get back on a schedule is HARD. But got some Espanol in and found this new show that is easy to follow in Spanish and short so it keeps my ADD attention span üòä.

A 2 bedroom apartment is for rent below me. It is definitely outdated, especially compared to my apartment since my apartment was "new-ish" when I moved in. No one had lived in it long term. Landlord says it is $9,000 pesos about $500 with the current exchange rate, no utilities included, and unfurnished. Not a bad deal at all. I would consider it but I said I wasn't going to buy furniture ever again until I bought my house. Plus it would be pretty interesting buying furniture here and getting it up two flights of stairs. I'm going to stay where I am. Plus I've done so much moving in the past 7 years...I'm TIRED.

And sorry about the video...I really need to take a photography and video shooting class. üòÑ

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
