I talk about one of my peeps who got robbed on Tuesday, how safe it REALLY is in Mexico City, safety in the United States, and how safe I feel in Mexico City in my podcast. I love Mexico City and this is my home now, especially since I'm a Permanent Resident. I will not be leaving anytime soon.

I have my first interview in Mexico City on Monday! I figured I'll go experience that here since I don't work here and then tell everyone about how the process goes. Plus I just received my Permanent Residency in March so couldn't work unless I got sponsored anyway. It's for a tech company so this should be interesting. Stay tuned...

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to México City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of México City nor even visited México before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in México and she is there to stay!
