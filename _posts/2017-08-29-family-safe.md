As you know my immediate family and extended family are in Houston. They are safe and hopefully continues to be safe. I have been doing my best to help out from afar with posting information and getting people connected to services. I wish I was there helping! It is CRAZY out there from the pictures I'm seeing and videos taken. I was supposed to fly out Sunday but it wasn't meant to be. Keep Houston in your prayers. Soon as everything dies down I'll be there to help out any way I can.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to MÃ©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of MÃ©xico City nor even visited MÃ©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in MÃ©xico and she is there to stay!
