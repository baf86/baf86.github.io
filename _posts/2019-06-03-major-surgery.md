<strong>EDIT</strong>: I forgot the cost! So the cost is highly inflated because I went to a dental office where all the expats go. After my first two horrific experiences, I said no more! These people know what they're doing because if word gets out they'll lose all that good expat money. The cost was $2,750 pesos or about $144. I literally could have gotten it done for $25 one dentist told me but at what future cost!?!?

I'm back! I've been having the WORST pain and unable to function and concentrate like I need to. Plus I guess I needed the break from pounding the pavement for <a href="https://beaforeigner.com" target="_blank">BeAForeigner.com</a>. I need to also do a story on that because I'm SO CLOSE to WINNING!

Last time I went to the dentist was right before I left for Guatemala so almost a year ago. I know, I know...terrible of me! But when you're having so much fun and on a mission...you forget!

I know better too because the white fillings do not last long for me. I've had a white filling last less than 6 months for me. I can't tell you WHY they don't last long for me, but they just don't.

So due to my circumstances, I needed a root canal. I'll have to make a video on that whole ordeal because typing it out doesn't do the story justice. So stay tuned for that!

After research, I decided to get it pulled. It's a dead tooth in your head and if your arm died would you keep it attached to your body? NO. So I don't know who came up with this root canal garbage. Every person I've ever known has had to get it fixed again or eventually tooth removal. It breeds harmful bacteria constantly too that can go straight to your blood stream. I'm good.

So Saturday, I go to get the tooth removed. I asked for drugs to calm me because I have severe anxiety and panic attacks. The process was smooth and the tooth was very easy to remove.

Surprisingly, I have not been in too much pain nor am I swollen. This is night and day between getting my wisdom teeth pulled because those teeth weren't dead. My mouth feels funny of course because I'm missing a tooth. I also can't eat certain foods I love so I'm more pissed about that than anything. I just bought some pitaya I can't even eat because of the seeds.

I'm happy with my decision.

Now I have to find an implant dentist to get a fake tooth.

I'll be hitting the dentist every THREE MONTHS because these white fillings don't last long in my head.

Oh and I'm officially a <strong><em>CHIMUELA</em></strong> in Mexico...a toothless woman! Ha!

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
