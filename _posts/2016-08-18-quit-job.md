<strong>SO like I promised the story on leaving work...</strong>

I was an Auditor for the Air Force and worked on base. I was not your typical Auditor in that I was an Internal Auditor and I performed operational audits. I had the power to look at anything on base and find out if those in control were following guidance. So, basically I made sure people were following the rules and I wrote a report on what I thought they should be doing and they agreed.

I spent a little over a year there (well a year and a week and a half). I worked in a small office with 5 other people (5 females, 1 male). I wasn't used to working in such a small office but I got used to it. The lonely male got hired right after me and left after 4 months on the job...funny thing is he went overseas too. Everyone was in everyone's business and I hated that.

From the day I walked in there I knew it was a mistake, but I just needed some experience to sit for the CPA. The bathroom was on the first floor while we worked on the second floor. We had to go up and down the stairs with a non-working elevator. The water coming out of the sink was brown and we had no clean drinking water. We had to buy our own water to lug up and down the stairs every day. My boss expected me to wear heels to work every day and chastised me like I was her child when I wore my Birkenstock Mary Janes to work each day. My coworkers and I were constantly talked down to like children and told auditing may not be for us. We were expected to be at our desks for 8 hours out of the day with no breaks and if we wanted a break we had to stay extra time at the end of the day. I could go on for hours...but I'll stop there.

<strong>The day I left...</strong>

I stayed until I received my automatic promotion at the end of July and one more pay period. The base had a change in command so no one was in the office but the new person when I arrived. I gathered up my things and decided this was the best time to leave. I got my boss a card and wrote in it that she should read the book of Genesis about Joseph since she believes people don't come together to conspire against you. She was always stating how she was a Christian but sure didn't act like one. I stuck my resignation letter, credit card, ID, and key in there and slid it under her door. She texted me and left me a voicemail saying I need to contact her. She sent me an email with the form I needed to fill out and the person I needed to send it to. I sat on it for two weeks before I sent it in.

I had already packed my things into my car EARLY that morning so all I had to do was go home finish packing a few things in my car and grab my dog. She threatened me by saying if I left she would call the base police on me and have me detained. So I made sure I left within the hour and continued on. My first stop was Phoenix then on the Los Angeles the next day and then on my way to Sacramento which is home. I made it home around 2:30pm on Sunday. It feels so great to be back home.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M&eacute;xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M&eacute;xico City nor even visited M&eacute;xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M&eacute;xico and she is there to stay!
