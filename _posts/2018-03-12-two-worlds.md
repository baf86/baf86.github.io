I straddle two worlds and it gets tiring. I don't know if I'll ever fully assimilate into Mexican culture or claim Mexico as my home.

Now that I am a permanent resident of Mexico I can finally breathe with ease. No more anxiety about whether they'll let me into Mexico. I can decorate my home and leave important things here knowing I can just "walk across the border" if I like.

I go "home" A LOT because I miss my family most of the time. Sometimes I actually have business to take care of. *Shout out to my father for allowing me to sleep on his couch for weeks at a time with no payment ‚ù§Ô∏è*

When I step off the plane it's like I'm in another world. Of course, the people are different...I actually see Black people! I have to deal with race relations. The food is different...which makes me sick. The air is even different. I have to switch back to English which is a very difficult task even with my basic Spanish. I'll forget where I am and say Hola or Si! The prices are outrageous. I can't just walk into a doctor's office or buy medicine over the counter without a prescription. I can walk into the pharmacy and get whatever I like. If I cant get it I just walk around the corner and talk to the Dr for FREE, he writes me a prescription, and I get my medicine. Went ‚Äúhome‚Äù and tried to buy 4 Mucinex for one of my associates here. They told me I could only get 2. I‚Äôm said eh!?? Forgot where I was for a second.

And the list goes on...I can talk all day about the negatives of living in the US and how they hold their citizens hostage.

I walked onto the soil of Mexico on faith and I'll scream at the top of my lungs until the day I die how much this place changed my life. Funny thing is I never had a plan for ANY of this. I have been just taking it day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, second by second. I have had to figure out most of this all by myself, no one set out a plan for me.

I wonder what my mother would think of my new life. Who would have thought I'd be living in Mexico and just having the time of my life?

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
