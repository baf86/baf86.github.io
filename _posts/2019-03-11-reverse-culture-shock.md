Whoo! What a week I've had! Last week was the first full week of the launch of my business <a href="http://www.beaforeigner.com" target="_blank">BeAForeigner.com</a> and I got hits from around the world! I pitched to my first investors in POLAND on Thursday! I wasn't even nervous because I know my stuff and I enjoy talking about my life and my business. I didn't get any negative feedback but got tons of great feedback and they even gave me an important connection for my business!

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M&eacute;xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M&eacute;xico City nor even visited M&eacute;xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M&eacute;xico and she is there to stay!
