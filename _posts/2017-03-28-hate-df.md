<strong>Noise.</strong> With a city of over 25 million people you're bound to hear SOMETHING! In my first apartment I heard fireworks all day long. You would swear I was in a war zone as they sounded like missiles! My neighborhood threw a party one time and it started at 11pm and went to the NEXT DAY around 8pm. Good thing I can sleep through anything if I'm tired enough. My neighborhood is "quiet". I hear traffic noise from around 8am to 9pm at night, but I love it here. My neighborhood is so nice and has everything I need.

<strong>Driving.</strong> Aw the perks of living in a big city. There is no real structure to driving out here. Anything goes! They drive stick shifts so a ride is bumpy automatically. I keep telling myself I'm going to ride the train and bus more, but Uber is so convenient and cheap. I can't give it up. Plus I swear I can't breathe on the subway for whatever reason or it's my anxiety kicking in.

<strong>Roads.</strong> Alot of the roads here are in disarray. There are bumpy and does not feel good driving over them. Alot of streets have humps to drive over too which makes riding in a small car unbearable. I'd imagine cars need alot of alignments out here.

<strong>Cars.</strong> Everyone drives a stick shift out here. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. I know if I was to rent a car I would be able to get automatic. But I think I should learn how to drive a stick sooner rather than later. I appreciate that most people drive small cars and not gas guzzlers to help with traffic and pollution.

<strong>Prices.</strong> Some things I can get for cheap back home is expensive here and vice versa so it's all relative. I'm not a consumer anymore so it doesn't bother me much. But my apple cider vinegar and aloe juice is expensive out here. I want to bring back bottles of both when I go back home.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to MÃ©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of MÃ©xico City nor even visited MÃ©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in MÃ©xico and she is there to stay!
