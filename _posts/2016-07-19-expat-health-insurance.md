I am still planning on going to China. Hoping and praying my mother gets well so I don't have to worry about my her and my father as much. To keep my mind off things, I decided to search for health and travel insurance.

üöë <i><a href="https://www.sevencorners.com/?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">Seven Corners</a> - Travel/Health insurance in case you get hurt, sick, or lose your luggage</i><br>

I highly recommend <a href="https://www.sevencorners.com?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">Seven Corners</a> to buy health and travel insurance. For health and travel insurance I chose <a href="https://www.sevencorners.com?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">Seven Corners</a> to include emergency medical and travel insurance in case my luggage gets lost or my flights get cancelled. It cost me $360.00 total for an annual plan. I think the plan is well worth it. I love the fact that they give you an app for your phone that comes in 53 different languages that give a medical provider important information about you and the insurance you have. <a href="https://www.sevencorners.com?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">Seven Corners</a> has received decent reviews online so hopefully I will never need it.

I also booked my flight from Beijing to Mianyang, but I'll talk about that tomorrow.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M&eacute;xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M&eacute;xico City nor even visited M&eacute;xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M&eacute;xico and she is there to stay!
