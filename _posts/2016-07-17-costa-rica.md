Sadly I will not be going to Costa Rica this week. My mother has been sick for a long time and we don't know why. She has been getting blood transfusions for the past few weeks as her red blood cells have been dropping drastically. My mother was supposed to  have met her maker on Friday as her blood count was so low. I flew home as quickly as I could Friday night to be with my parents. She's doing much better now but I'm scared to leave. I plan to go back home either during the week or next weekend. We'll see how things go as my mother is supposed to come home tomorrow.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M&eacute;xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M&eacute;xico City nor even visited M&eacute;xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M&eacute;xico and she is there to stay!
