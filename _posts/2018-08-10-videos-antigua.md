Learning Spanish has been GLORIOUS. I LOVE my teacher and she is wonderful at what she does. I've learned so much in a week by being one on one. I highly recommend doing private lessons over group lessons. I can ask questions quickly and be corrected when I am wrong without waiting for someone else in a class. All I think and see is Spanish now. I spoke so much Spanish yesterday my brain hurt and I literally wanted to CRY.

I went to a chocolate museum and a wine tasting on Wednesday. I'll write about that tomorrow and post the pictures as I am TIRED. Tomorrow will be a better day. As for now here are a few videos I shot yesterday. Oh! And there was an earthquake yesterday...fun fun! I was hoping I would be here a little while before I felt one...oh well such is life.

Walking the cobblestone streets of Antigua. The whole city looks like this and it's easy to get lost!<br>

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
