How am I on day #6 of my quarantine in Mexico? Please stop waiting on other people...they're a detriment to your success. What's going on after the lock down in Mexico? Looting? Police violence? Domestic violence?

Hey, I think I'm on episode number 75.

0:05  
last count, but my name is Elise Robinson and I am a black American woman that lives in Mexico. I have been here almost four years now. And why do I live in Mexico because my mother passed away from blood cancer in November 2016. And so I didn't have anything left. I quit my whole life to take care of my mother and help my family. And so I decided to try a new adventure and go explore new country somewhere else. So I set it all Mexico, even though all you hear is a cartel is dangerous. And so I had a whole bunch of Southwest points. And I saw put them a yard can can clean Cabo. And so Mexico City was the cheapest place I could fly to with the points. And so I was like, well don't check out Mexico City and never heard of Mexico City before. Never even stepped foot in Mexico before. Even I lived on the border twice, which is sad but like I said, you always get the rumors and everything. So I have to flight about a week at my mother's funeral and I've pretty much been here ever since. I told my father

1:23  
caught him up on the phone tell him I was coming back.

1:27

And check out via force comm I have updated it to make it into like a community. Please join a community before it starts before I start charging. Join the community before I started charging and I'm going to have videos on there. And of course daily opportunities to move overseas and I want to invite people to talk and everything else so because Facebook is getting on my nerves and plastic a charge on Facebook right so so and I'll say why Facebook's you know when there's so check out at least opposite COMM And check out via foreigner comm if you're thinking about moving overseas especially after all this Coronavirus stuff be sure to hit the like button. If you love me donate my cash app is down below. There's also a link where you can donate in whatever currency you urine in your country. Um so let's get right into it. Just update on me. This is day 13 I think it is I already lost Canada days and I've been in a house.

I ain't been outside except to drop my garbage out.

2:57  
Which sometimes I actually forget But anyways are asleep they were sleeping eat now try to work on some stuff. So Afro Afro is looking looking nice like an afro a little bit little bit

3:18  
because of course I haven't had a haircut since January yes this is January so

3:27  
money depression coming out

3:31  
Yeah, I'm tender headed so a much I'm gonna do on that. This is why I say bye. See what else day 13 I thought I was gonna go out to the bank but I don't really have a need to go to the bank. So I think I'm gonna just stay where I am at this point.

3:57  
Facebook Oh yeah, Facebook. So I got blocked today for 30 days because

4:05  
because I said Americans are mentally ill. If Facebook didn't like that, I mean, I keep seeing videos of people out jogging and at the church and having get togethers and they just can't sit in house must be able to extrovert people. It just literally must be all the extrovert people because I consider myself to be an introvert. I entertain myself very well. I don't I don't mind being alone. And that's the greatest that'd be around other people, sickly people that so extroverts is going to get us killed. So if you have an extrovert family member, please tell them to stay ass in the house. I mean, I don't know. But I think the big reason why I got I got blocked is because I shared a video that's in New York. We're about Or piled up in wasn't even in the morgue it was just like, downstairs probably underground. I know a lot of hospitals have underground facilities that you would never even know about. And they were just piled up in there. So I share that to about 10 different people. And the funny part is if you look at my my, I guess blocks for today, they have been blocking me trying to block me since early this morning. They couldn't get a reason to. So they finally found a reasons as I said, Americans are mentally ill and I got 30 days. So that's one reason why I need to get up off of Facebook and start my own community. So please, please, please, please check out via foreigner calm and join the community before I start charging, huh? Otherwise, you don't get shy. Um, let me see what else anything else that's going on. I mean, my sister as a healthcare worker, she's telling me is starting to get kinda Bad in Houston she's telling me that ICU is full of Coronavirus paints it patients on Vence she told me there was one person I was trying to die on them and I won't I won't give you too much information but there's there's a lot of Coronavirus patients are listening Houston as an ICU. She says pretty much the end the hospitals empty. So for ICU, maybe that's why when I went to the hospital here in Mexico, it was emptied a lot of patients as an ICU maybe possibly. But it was it was dead as a doorknob in there and plus they're not letting people come through. So I don't know what to think at this point. But yeah, Mexico we can do an update on Mexico. I don't want to I don't want to make this video too long. Like my other video. I mean, I really ain't got no updates to be talking about anyway. I can't really update anything if you missed it in the house. And I just basically just read through Coronavirus stuff a lot of a lot of times throughout the day. I'm outside of trying to get my own stuff done, but it's becoming. It's becoming a lot. It's become a lot. So. Um, so yesterday was Sunday. Right. So I'll give you the date for Sunday because I think it's been a week since since I've updated you guys. So Sunday, which was April

7:35  
Yeah, what well, we have 4219 cases. And then the

7:44  
the case lead away recuperation for corporations, trying to read it as Spanish at the same time.

7:53  
1772 and then people that die was cylindricity 73 naps a day and we can do the math on that sounds about 400 extra cases almost. So that's 4661 cases confirmed. And then about 100, recuperation

8:17  
is 1843.

8:20  
And then 296 people died. So that was a change of 20 right there. So,

um, I mean, it's slow, but of course, zero is always good. I mean, you don't want to get a zero on the test. We want to get zero out here, right. update on my chest because I totally forgot about this. So I decided I was gonna wait about two weeks before I started exercising because all I've been doing here is sitting in the house. I don't walk anymore. I don't do anything. And I've actually put on some weight. Believe that but This morning was the first one I woke up with my chest tonight you know feel tight and bother me so I don't know if I should wait another day just to be on the safe side to see if I could have two days in a row. But I don't forget to start exercising I'll be having a blood clot Next we will just lay them in a bed and not necessarily moving around too much. So I'm gonna get into some aerobics. First thing in the morning hopefully. That's all I got at this point. So again, check out Elise Robinson comm check out via forum comm sign up for the community.
