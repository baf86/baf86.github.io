Went to one of the many malls out here today which is called <a href="https://www.parquedelta.com.mx/" target="_blank">Parque Delta</a>. This mall is right near a bus and train stop and very easy to get to. They have everything you can think although I'm mad they don't have a Forever 21 store in this one...so I guess they don't. I was looking for a bathing suit and they also have a grocery store in there so picked up some food. I've had the same bathing for about seven years. I know, I'm ashamed. But at least I didn't put on any weight! I also went here to give you an idea of what the malls look like out here. This mall is four levels and very big with all kinds of places to eat such as Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Krispy Kreme, and PF Chang. I go here for my "home food fix". Very clean, bright, very well organized. No one inside or outside loitering or begging (things I've experienced in US malls in many cities). It's just a very pleasant shopping experience all around.

Hopped in Uber and decided to do Uber Pool (ugh!). The guy totally missed my stop! I'm like ok maybe he's going to stop on the side of the building but he kept going. Finally, I said something before he missed the mall completely. I don't know if Uber was giving him wrong directions or what but I got there.

My grocery store experience was pleasant and quick. This was the first time I've stepped foot in this store. I guess no one shops at the mall store since it's a little overpriced. I was in and out in an hour. The only thing they were out of was batteries. I'll walk down to Radioshack tomorrow to grab some. This store also has a lot of US products that I love.

I checked out and panicked like can I take the basket outside the mall? I'd have to walk a little way to get to where Uber usually parks. Turns out I can't take the basket that far out but the man was nice enough to let me do it after I said "Uber". Waited on my Uber while it was raining. My Uber driver was very nice and helped me with my groceries to the front door. Forever grateful.

A few people batted their eyes at my bald head but most minded their own business. Sorry, I don't have photos of the mall as it started raining so I went straight to the grocery store. I did manage to snap a picture of Cheesecake Factory before I hopped in the car.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to MÃ©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of MÃ©xico City nor even visited MÃ©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in MÃ©xico and she is there to stay!
