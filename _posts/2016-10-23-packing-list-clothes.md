Alright so I got my packing list together. I also bought a <a href="https://amzn.to/36mNm4v" target="_blank">Sea To Summit Ultra-Sil Compression Dry Sack - Grey Large</a> to compress my clothes and other belongings to fit snugly in my backpack. Here is my packing list for clothes:

‚õ±Ô∏è <i><a href="https://www.visahq.com/?a_aid=vaff9616" target="_blank">VisaHQ</a> - Help in obtaining your visa if needed</i><br>

<a href="https://amzn.to/2tNZVZ7" target="_blank">Thorlo Long Walking Socks</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2tLdKaQ" target="_blank">Thorlo Short Walk Socks</a> (2 pairs of each)<br>
I need comfortable socks to walk in and I tried Thorlo socks a few years ago and fell in love <strong>*UPDATE</strong> I only added 3 pairs to my cart so I have 2 short pairs and 1 long pair. I may just buy another pair off of Amazon if I have time<br>
<a href="https://amzn.to/36jBCzp" target="_blank">Nylon Period Panties</a> (6 pairs) - Nylon is thin and quick drying plus doesn't hold odors well
Sweaters (2 pairs) - I got my sweaters from JCPenney as they sell tall and are good quality. They are pretty thick so I'm only packing two.<br>
<a href="https://www.forever21.com/us/shop/catalog/product/f21/top_blouses/2000116623" target="_blank">Tank Tops</a> (4 pairs) - I'll probably end up packing way more as they are thin and add barely any weight. I got mine at Forever 21 as they last forever and are cheap in price. I can also wear them to bed too.<br>
<a href="https://www.forever21.com/us/shop/catalog/product/f21/dress/2000393019" target="_blank">Dresses</a> (2) - Again Forever21 makes great dresses and they last forever. I got two really thin and weightless dresses to wear for interviews and anything that may require dressing up a little. They also make long enough dresses that come down to my knees.<br>
Pants (2) - I got mine at Chadwicks as my mother was offering to get me a few pairs. I got two pairs of jeggings that fit well enough and also stretch enough to wear thermals underneath if I'm cold. Chadwicks doesn't exist anymore. ‚òπÔ∏è<br>
<a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Plus-Moda-Women-s-Flowy-Romantic-Short/50791868" target="_blank">Shorts</a> (4 pairs) - Got mine at Forever 21 and Walmart for cheap. I'll probably end up packing more as they're lightweight and don't take up space plus I can sleep and exercise in them too.<br>
Bras (4 pairs) - I gave up on underwire bras years ago. But I found some really nice sports bras during Victoria Secret's annual bra sale.<br>
Swimsuit - I've had the same swimsuit for about 6 years now. I got it from Hot Topic. SO yes they make quality swim suits. And yea I haven't gained much weight lol...<br>
<a href="https://www.tanga.com/deals/dc52634dd83a/2-pack-men-s-heavyweight-sherpa-fleece-lined-hoodies-s-2x" target="_blank">Jacket</a> - Still waiting on this one. But I got a two jackets from Tanga with sherpa fleece inside them. Won't pack this, but wear it on the plane. Didn't know the quality that's why I got two and leave one at home to come back to.<br>
Coat - When I moved to the Northeast I found out about Land's End. They make quality and affordable cold weather clothes. I pretty much bought all my clothes from them before I left. I found a really nice coat on there for 69.99 regular 139.99 then they were having a 50% off coupon. Total price with shipping came to $46. Yea I'm not a fan of the color either but $45 for a cold weather coat I can wear just about anywhere is a steal!<br>
<a href="https://amzn.to/2ROcVWV" target="_blank">Sarong</a> - I've been reading that this is a must have when traveling. It is so versatile and can be used for many different things.<br>
Wool Thermal Top (2) - Got a few at Jockey.com. I got men's small as I'm a tall woman but a small was TOO small for me and it's almost squeezing me. I'll make do though...I'll be using these as a base layer.<br>
Wool Thermal Bottom (2) - Also from Jockey.com...all they had was medium so that's what I got. They fit fine.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
