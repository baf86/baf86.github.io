Ok truth be told I haven't done anything substantial out here because I left my portable charger back home or lost it. I've also been focusing on my Spanish classes, grieving, and working on my business. I can't find a large enough charger to support my phone out here. Soon as I get back from going "home" next month I will be more out and about and doing things after school and weekends. I will also be moving into a more desirable area and location so I'm not far away from my school. I'll be moving into an apartment with a nice view and it's right by a train station AND I have a washer. I can't wait! I would post pics but somehow <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/elyser93?currency=USD">Airbnb</a> corrupts the pics after downloading.

When I come back from visiting my family and picking up a "care package"...I will be visiting this place called <a href="http://www.grutastolantongo.com.mx">Grutas Tolantongo</a>. It looks like heaven and I'm here for it. I will be doing a food tour week after next. Can't really leave the city yet because of my phone situation and I need Uber!

I can't believe next weekend is Christmas! I'll be sitting at home and make sure I have food stocked up so I don't have to starve. Wonder if I can find a turkey? Lol I'm trying to figure out do I want to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucha_libre">Lucha Libre</a> or <a href="http://www.mutemgaribaldi.mx/museo.html">tequila tasting</a> next weekend. I'm leaning towards getting my drink on so I'll probably save the Lucha Libre experience for another day.

Going to weigh myself when I get back "home" all this good eating I think I put on some weight but my arms will never get right. They'll stay bony forever. I haven't been exercising like I should but I do walk a lot. I've found yoga places and when I get to my new neighborhood I'm sure there will be plenty of things I can try out and work on my spanish.

I've been looking for an art class because I've been saying for YEARS I want to take one. This is the best time to work on my spanish and take either a painting, sculpture, or ceramics class here. I posted my question in a group but didn't get too many answers...blah. I'm going to also look into cooking classes as I want to try new things.

I have two weeks left of my spanish class at my language school. I wish I had did my research a little more before coming as I could have studied at a university here for cheaper and been more engulfed in the culture. But it's ok I'm still learning and I didn't need to stress myself out too much anyway. The classes at the university start in January but I'll have to see because I'll be gone for a few days back home.

I'm going back home in January for my nephew's birthday, take care of some business, and get some things that I must have here. They use real sugar and I want that processed crap. The real sugar tastes like poison to me! I love oatmeal too much.

Happy Holidays to everyone!

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
