This is episode number 71. Hi, my name is Elise Robinson am a black woman that lives in Mexico. And why am I in Mexico, my mother passed away from blood cancer in 2016 in November, and so I didn't have anything left. I quit my whole life to help take care of my family and my mother. And so I decided to, you know, go live somewhere else. If I didn't like it, I could always come back right. And so, I decided on going to Mexico City, Mexico, had never been to Mexico even though I lived on the border twice. You guys hear about the cartel and you know, they snatching folks and everything else. In Mexico City is one of the largest cities on Earth. So it's a big city.

And last night I had a seizure. It's been a long time since I've had a seizure.

2:19

is when the auras started an aura when you have epilepsy is basically a warning that you're going to have one eventually. You don't know when but you're going to have one. So um, I've been having them for weeks now, I guess a month at this point. So and that's right around the time that the corona virus really started popping off was like December. So

2:58  
I've been kind of stressed and ever since I guess

3:01  
trying to figure out what the hell's going on prepare, worried about my family, my friends

3:09  
myself, so

3:14  
so yeah

3:17  
I don't want to go too deep in and maybe I'll talk about on different podcasts but I'm going to go see a pulmonologist hopefully on Wednesday because my ass I've been having asthma attack like almost every day but I've been taking my allergy pills I didn't really want to start on allergy pills because I didn't think it was that bad and I was going to get better but I never did so

3:40  
I haven't had asthma attacks and

3:42  
stuff and taken out because though, but

3:47  
I'm good had this point I suppose. I need to keep the stress down. I really ain't been sleeping. I ate nothing I'm about to grab. I'm about to eat me something I ate since yesterday. Technically. So in my little bony ass needs to eat everything in sight, so um

4:09  
yeah.

4:11  
But updates on Corona virus. So last night was the first death a 55 year old man here. I haven't I haven't checked the news this morning since I've been out and about. But I didn't see anything last night and super early this morning when I woke up about it. So I don't know what's going on in mainstream media. And the funny part, I guess if is if you want to say it's funny is that I got notification through this app called rappy is the delivery app, it'll deliver you whatever you want. And so so around nine o'clock last night, I got a screenshot of it, because I was just like in shock and it's for history purposes. See it You know, I mean, all this is gonna go down in history books. So I mean, there's that's a piece of history right there at this point.

5:14  
So yeah, notification through the delivery app

5:17  
that the first man died here. Supposedly there's only 46 cases. I don't know how true that is. But it seems like all the people that are spreading the disease are not even Asian. They're white. So I don't know what that's about.

5:34  
Supposedly, there was a recent case that I read about.

üõ¥ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=384325&mid=11018&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2593003&clickref=" target="_blank">Viator</a> - Reserve your tour now and pay later</i>

5:39  
The other day, it was a woman. She was vacationing in Spain. So my guess is that she's white, because you know, the so called real Mexicans do not vacation in Spain. Those are the white ones. So she came back with the disease and she's probably spreading it and that was in clinic. So, Cancun is about four hours here by bus for me. So it's coming. It's coming. It's coming.

6:15  
I don't know what else to say on that.

6:22  
I wish Mexico will close the borders at this point.

6:26  
People are still vacationing here flying in, and especially in Mexico City where they have flights from Asia, and pretty much every major city in Europe. We need to close the borders. I'm seeing pictures of people, you know, living it up and can't come in and it's just fucking crazy at this point. So I don't know, I don't know what Mexico is going to do. They claim 50% of the economy and Mexico is tourism. I know they don't want to give it up but they don't have to do something to protect their citizens at this point. So so yeah I appreciate the United States closing some you know, close and awesome the flights from

7:09  
Europe

üóø <i><a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/ee4bce1e-84de-4387-a735-d59d04539960" target="_blank">Groupon</a> - Have used this web site for YEARS to find all kinds of deals in multiple cities all over the world.</i>

7:12  
and Asia

7:15  
I'm

7:18  
I'm tired. I even sleep in like a thank straight. So I know Guatemala has closed their borders, I believe believes has closed there's so I mean, I guess at this point, they're not really a threat.

7:34  
I don't know what to say.

7:37  
But right. I'm here in Mexico, only down with my peeps. So I don't think I'm going to go back to the States. I went to the store today and grabbed some medicine for my asthma. I just thought to myself, I can't go back home because I mean, All my money would be depleted. Like, like that.

10:47  
I don't know what to think. But

10:50  
I have a trip that comes that I'm supposed to go on a trip on Thursdays in country so it's not like I'm leaving the country because I'm scared if I leave, I might not be able to get back in would never do that but um especially as a non citizen I don't know if I'm gonna go I'll see what things is looking like Thursday so I don't know I will keep y'all updated though what's going on in Mexico I don't know if other people broadcasts and stuff that's going on in Mexico but like I said, again, this is the information that I have this long thing I can go on at this point. So play the stock market though. I made I made some good money today alone is ridiculous. It's ridiculous how much money you can make right now. So if you got some extra money, drop some dollars in there. Just jobs in Dallas, please, please drop some Dallas. But yeah, my name is Luis Ramos. And check out the blog Elise Robinson, calm be a foreigner.com and I'm getting out of here because I'm hungry.
