This is episode number 79, I think. And my name is Elise Robinson. I am a black American woman that lives in Mexico and you're probably wondering why I'm here.

0:14  
Unfortunately, my mother passed away from blood cancer in November 2016. And so I didn't have anything left. I quit my whole life to take care of my mother and help my family. And so, since I didn't have anything left, I decided to go explore the world and I settled on Mexico. I always hear bad things about Mexico like, you know, the cartel and kidnap people, which is true, very, very true.

0:42  
Because I could talk about the kidnapping very well. Um,

0:49  
and so I even lived on the border twice and never even stepped foot in Mexico because of the stories. And so you always hear about Puerto Vallarta, Cancun, Cabo and such.

1:00  
decided on Mexico City because I had never heard of it. didn't know anything about it. So

1:06  
hopped a flight, Southwest flight where I had a bunch of points. It was the cheapest place so that's where I went to ended up falling in love with Mexico City caught my father and tell them Daddy, I'm not coming back. It's like Okay, take care. And I've pretty much been here ever since.

because anything else I'm taking, I have some emergency packets, which I take sometimes build up immunity and stuff. Lots of water, lots of water, which I drink naturally. Only two things I really drink is water line. And I can't get liquor anymore, which will kind of set about not that I really need it but this time I'm like, dang, I wish I could have a glass of wine. But they took that away from me, which is my fault because I should have stopped it. I should got like six bottles, but

5:51  
oh well hindsight is 2020 right.

5:55  
Ah, let me see what else. Yeah, it has been in the house.

6:02  
I really haven't been bored. I've been keeping myself busy. I'm

6:10  
pretty sure my relationships are probably gonna suffer that I've seen anyone. But

6:18  
I can't expose myself to people. At this point. I just I just can't do that with my asthma.

6:25  
My X ray just did not look good. didn't look good at all. So

6:32  
I can't go get another one at this point because I don't know what's going on outside. I couldn't even tell you what's going on inside. I don't know.

📋 <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=385311&mid=17309&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2600115&clickref=" target="_blank">Soda PDF</a> - PDF software 95% less than Adobe. Create, Convert, Edit, Annotate, Sign all your pdf files today.</i>

6:41  
I read an article that a man was walking around with symptoms here. And he eventually passed out on the ground and they took him to the hospital and he died there. Now I did not say if he had the world or not, but at this point, what else could it be?

7:00  
Right, the dude, the man didn't look old from the picture that they have posted.

7:05  
The picture was from the back of him laying in the in the hospital chair, but he didn't like all at all. So there was another woman that just died. She was at the grocery store exposing people.

7:20  
It wasn't here. It was a bird outside of where I live, and she just died. It didn't say she had the role of but what else could it be at this point, right.

7:32  
So those are stories I'm getting.

7:36  
Hopefully Mexico is not being censored, like it is in the States because the states, I mean, the whole world is being censored at this point.

7:47  
the only country that has not been censored for whatever reason, which I'm like really, I'm really puzzled by is Ecuador. Ecuador is really, people are really posting real, real videos.

8:00  
stuff people lead in the street dead from this

8:04  
coffins bodies everywhere

8:09  
I'm not gonna

8:15  
you know speculate too much but the internet is being heavily censored at this point I couldn't tell you why why they want to censor the internet and

🤳 <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=320330&mid=10855&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2187178&clickref=" target="_blank">OnePlus</a> - Grab a smartphone that won this year's Best Smartphone Award</i>

8:25  
not show what's really going on in the world because if 100 plus countries have this Why are there no videos? Are there no videos?

8:36  
So yeah, but if you want to search for Ecuador and watch the videos real live videos that's going on in Ecuador with with lots of people dying they said about 16,000 people have died in like 106 days I think they said it was

8:53  
sorry I should have this information that find you guys but it's a lot. It's a lot. Let me see if I can find it.

9:10  
So it says 6703 died in 15 days in April.

🖥️ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=354857&mid=16296&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2318096&clickref=" target="_blank">Screencast-O-Matic</a> - Easily Record, Edit, and Engage on your browser</i>

9:16  
And then the other one was, let me see if I can find that one.

9:23  
Here it is 10,000 10,939 people in 46 days in Ecuador, so, not to be brewing but they're dropping like flies in Ecuador. And if they're saying that people are dropping like that in New York and other places in the states

9:42  
there's no video there's no nothing, which is very shocking and unbelievable at this point, because I mean, people are getting online shaking their ass on tik tok. I've seen some crazy shit from tik tok. But yet we're not seeing any videos about this. But yeah, thousands of people are supposedly dying a day.

10:00  
De there's nobody from Italy there's nobody else in Spain there's nobody's from the States, only place I've been able to find is Ecuador. So

10:12  
just now if it gets that bad here in Mexico, and where I live it, I will stream Okay. I will stream I will not censor, okay.

10:23  
And I'll put it everywhere.

10:26  
Here in Mexico. I suspect a lot of people will pass eventually. Because a lot of people are obese.

10:36  
A lot of people have diabetes. A lot of people have high blood pressure.

10:42  
So there will probably be dead bodies in the streets here. For sure.

10:51  
I read an article yesterday, because they're saying all these young people are dying. And in the States, I guess, obesity

11:00  
Isn't talked about like it should be

⚽ <i><a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/c7103js0ys-FPGINKKGFHIOJOPMI" target="_blank">STA Travel</a> - Will beat the competition, guaranteed for travel!</i>

11:03  
in that it is a health condition. And let me find what I found. It's a very good article and they're still not even saying that obesity is a personal thing. They're coming out and saying all this other kind of bullshit, which is bullshit.

11:24  
They did a study in China. It says 112 patients reported that 17 of the patients who died 15 were either overweight or obese.

11:36  
Half of the 124 patients in France and I'm probably going to say it wrong Lily Lily France had obesity twice the rate of a comparison group of intensive care patients hospitalized for other reasons last year. Study also reported that the need for mechanical ventilation increased with higher body weight. So if you're overweight or obese out there, get on health plan progress.

🤓 <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=295463&mid=6798&awinaffid=323811&linkid=599979&clickref=" target="_blank">edX</a> - Take free online courses 24/7/365</i>

12:00  
So fast clicking in a hurry. It says a hospital national health in Louisiana. It says 41 hospitals in Southern Mississippi. It says that 60% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had obesity and that'll be C appear to nearly double their risk of requiring a ventilator. Now common sense to tell you know if you're overweight, fat, whatever it is you have extra extra weight around your lungs, right you have extra weight around your diaphragm, which helps you breathe. So

12:36  
again, if you overweight or obese, get on work at work plan. Continue reading.

⛅ <i><a href="https://joinhoney.com/ref/759tu9o" target="_blank">Honey</a> - Find coupons and great deals whenever you shop online</i>

12:44  
It says physicians say patients with obesity can be harder to manage in the hospital setting. They require special bits of imaging equipment, they're harder to intubate. And harder to assess where I'm moving up into later.

12:58  
It says that the 14 patients recently in

13:00  
Doctors send me as critical care unit and mouse and eye on every side. She said 12 or at least 50 years old, I had complex medical problems. The two younger patients who were in their 30s had obesity and no other disease it looks like for them obesity is a risk factor.

13:15  
So, I mean, I can keep going on and on. I'm actually going to post the link on my blog

13:23  
because it's a good article to read very good article. And so every time you know somebody young would pass away, you know, I was thinking what did they look like, you know, not trying to be rude or mean or anything but people really think obesity and being overweight is not it's not risking their health, it's not healthy.

13:46  
and high blood pressure is known as a silent killer because a lot of people don't know they have it. And then a lot of people are pre diabetic

13:56  
and don't know they have diabetes. Eat

14:00  
So again,

14:02  
if you are in the house or whatever on board get on a workout plan even if you five pounds overweight because obesity is killing folks, young folks, killing people. And some I'm not not getting my hopes up about about Mexico because everybody here is big. I mean, it is shocking to me when I actually see somebody that's skinny.

14:28  
I'll stare, I'll stare.

14:32  
Literally I'll stare as I'm sure they stare at me. Because I'm tall, skinny and black. So

14:41  
that's one topic. I don't even know that I need to talk about what I want to talk about because this is important.

14:49  
Very important.

14:53  
Am I save that for next one, but to get into the numbers of Mexico because I don't want to make this too long.

15:00  
I think I talked about that next time.

15:04  
The numbers for yesterday and they jumped a lot. A lot. They jumped a lot. And so yesterday which was April

15:14  
17. Right now April 18. Okay.

⛱️ <i><a href="https://www.visahq.com/?a_aid=vaff9616" target="_blank">VisaHQ</a> - Help in obtaining your visa if needed</i>

15:19  
See, they didn't give me

15:22  
okay. So these are date these are this is from yesterday confirmed from yesterday writing

15:28  
a case is worth 6875 2627 recuperating

15:37  
and 546 people die.

15:40  
How these are just reported numbers don't mean are necessarily true right.

15:45  
And as of today

15:48  
7497 cases confirmed which is damn near like a 15

16:00  
Almost like 1000 1000 confirm. Yeah, almost 1000 almost 1000 confirmed almost 1000 difference.

16:10  
They didn't give me a number for recuperation, I guess my vitamin Cooper a from yesterday, semester 2627 and then 650 people dies. So that's almost 100 increase from yesterday.

16:27  
increases are definitely increasing a lot.

16:31  
So

16:34  
like I said, it gets really bad here in Mexico, at least in the part I am. I will be reporting live Of course. I will post them on my blog. I post them everywhere that I can. Because

16:48  
the internet is being heavily censored.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to México City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of México City nor even visited México before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in México and she is there to stay!
