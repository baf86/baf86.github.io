A Black man (gay if that matters any) was in my inbox last night. He used to live in Guatemala and now lives in Mexico which is where I met him. I don‚Äôt really fool with him but I keep him around because he‚Äôs lived in Mexico for almost 20 years. He has a history of doing things I don‚Äôt like so I only fool with him in a group setting.

Anyway, he messaged me last night about the AfroGuatemalans then showed me Miss Black Guatemala. I found out it‚Äôs just a local competition because you know having a Negra represent the country would never go down. I didn‚Äôt know it was local before saying well why the hell do they keep staring at me then? Yes, it‚Äôs pretty damn bad here with the gawking and the staring. And also I <a href="https://elyserobinson.com/toe-fuckery" target="_blank">went to a spa</a> here and they took a picture of me WITHOUT MY PERMISSION then posted it on their Facebook page. I told them to TAKE THAT SHIT DOWN and reported it to Facebook too so if they try to be sly it won‚Äôt post.

He proceeds to tell me that is <em>admiration</em>. Excuse me? So someone taking pics without your permission and just looking ugly gawking at you while eating or shopping or doing WHATEVER is admiration now? I was eating today at a restaurant and a man stopped to gawk at me looking all evil.

He told me just like in Mexico...NO this has NEVER happened there. People don‚Äôt gawk at me and surely ain‚Äôt out flashing pics of me. I‚Äôm left the hell alone. Then he says I don‚Äôt know why Black women don‚Äôt like to be admired. I told him look we can go back and forth all damn day about this but THAT IS NOT ADMIRATION. That‚Äôs looking at you like you‚Äôre a freak show or sometimes even being sexualized.

I told him there are numerous threads in another group about this same topic. People putting a camera in your face, gawking, following you around, touching you, etc etc...but it‚Äôs admiration huh?!?

He is now blocked and I don‚Äôt give a care in the world. Don‚Äôt ever tell me how to feel 1. As a BLACK WOMAN 2. Then proceed to tell me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why Black women don‚Äôt like this‚Äù. When I‚Äôm clearly telling you it‚Äôs wrong what another person is doing. 3. You‚Äôre not a Black woman your damn self. You don't walk in my shoes every day.

Too bad because I'm sure I'll run into him eventually in Mexico City, but what can I do? My motto is: Life is too short for fuckery. I have no time for games.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
