Yesterday I booked my flight from Beijing to Mianyang. I used Expedia to see what airlines were flying on the date I was leaving Beijing. I decided I'll stay a night in Beijing to rest before flying out to Mianyang where I'll meet the university representatives. More on that later...

The airlines flying were: Air China, Hainan Airlines, Sichuan Airlines, Chine Eastern, and a few others out of my price range. I looked at the reviews for each airline and none of them were great. Hainan Airlines had decent reviews so I chose them. I was going to book with Expedia but did a bit more research on booking Chinese airlines. I found out about Ctrip and Elong. They were reliable web sites from what I read.

Elong was difficult to navigate so I booked with Ctrip. The Chinese web sites were much, much cheaper to book on. I chose a first class flight on Hainan Airlines for a few dollars more than what I was going to pay for economy on Expedia. The web site was very easy to use and understand. I even tried out their mobile app but I don't know if I could use it since I have an international credit card...it wouldn't work for me.

I booked using Paypal for $293.39 which included the flight, fees, and Paypal fees. I got confirmation of the purchase right away and ticket number a few minutes after. I tried seeing if I could find my flight on Hainan Airlines no go on that so I'll give it a few more days and call if their online system still doesn't find me.

I'll talk about my hotel booking tomorrow.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M&eacute;xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M&eacute;xico City nor even visited M&eacute;xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M&eacute;xico and she is there to stay!
