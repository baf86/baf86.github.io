Of course, my living expenses have changed since moving here. I'm at the 9 month mark (can't believe it) of living here. Here is the <a href="https://elyserobinson.com/expenses-gave-up" target="_blank">original post I did</a>. These are estimates and I don't spend this every month and some months I spend a bit more. Rounding has also been used. AND of course, these numbers can change if the dollar is weak to the peso (which it has been since moving here).

üçæ <i><a href="https://act.webull.com/i/JRub9zUK6PMT/fkw" target="_blank">Webull</a></i> - Deposit any amount and receive a free stock

<em>Rent ($480) - This is supposed to change every month because my landlord thinks he's slick by saying dollars instead of pesos. I give him $8200 pesos every month and he accepts it.

<em>Life Insurance</em> ($1) - Have to keep that

<em><a href="https://www.sevencorners.com" target="_blank">Health Insurance</a> ($35) - In case my body needs to be brought back to the states and also includes health insurance where I can be reimbursed for anything medically related. I will also purchase a travel insurance policy one of these days since I plan to be traveling within Mexico more.

ü¶Ö <i><a href="https://www.onedrone.com/store/1-gram-520-tvl-nano-camera-with-audio-1-gram-520-tvl-nano-camera-with-audio.html?tracking=5e4d6ad378714" target="_blank">One Drone</a> - Create amazing vacation videos with a new drone</i>

<em><a href="https://www.virtualpostmail.com" target="_blank">Virtualpostmail.com</a></em> ($15) - To receive mail from the states. The service scans the mail and lets me know what I have.

<em>Telmex</em> ($55) - I got my own internet service as the one in the building is not reliable and I NEED my internet to be reliable to make money. The internet is expensive here but WAY faster than anything I ever had in the US. I get 100mbps and could have gotten 200mbps for extra money.

<em>Telcel</em> ($30) - T-mobile finally cut me off and I had to get Mexican service. I get up to 7gbs per month, unlimited data for Facebook, Uber, and WhatsApp for the price.

<em><a href="http://www.anveo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anveo</a></em> ($3) - A US phone number so people can call me. If you sign up, please use referral code: 7488707. Thank you!

<em><a href="https://www.uber.com/invite/elyser416ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uber</a></em> ($50) - I don't drive and just use Uber. Each ride is between $3-10 depending on where I'm going.

<em>Food</em> ($250) - I cook now so my bill came down a little bit.

<em>Entertainment</em> ($75) - This includes going out to different events and eating out at restaurants.

üåª <i><a href="https://www.printful.com/start-your-online-store-without-inventory/a/1854514:450bfe266f4da83c5d4941174baf6d27" target="_blank">Printful</a> - Become an online entrepreneur and start an online store without inventory</i>

<em>VPN</em> ($8) - Need this to access certain websites in english.
<strong><em>Total about $995 per month</em></strong>

This list also doesn't include bus/train fare, yearly or bi-yearly things like dental check ups and physicals, domain name, hosting (that's why you need to donate :), and flights back home. Long term expenses like passport, driver's license, tax filing fees, etc. etc. etc.

I think that's it...

<strong>*UPDATE: <a href="http://www.baselang.com" target="_blank">I forgot my Spanish lessons for $129/month</a>. So total is about $1125/month</strong>

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
