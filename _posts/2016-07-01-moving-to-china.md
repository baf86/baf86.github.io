I set up this blog for my Black brothers and sisters to have an idea of what it is like to explore the world. I am an Auditor by trade and have been doing that for the past two and half years. But I always knew I wanted to teach business courses for a living. Auditing is not difficult but it stretches my multitasking skills to the limit. Hate to say I‚Äôm not good at multitasking‚Ä¶I need to focus on one thing at a time. SO I‚Äôve been searching for a teaching job since March. I didn‚Äôt know if I wanted to teach adults or kids so I went and got my teaching license. Arizona makes it too easy to get a teaching license if you‚Äôre in the business field. I just submitted a background check and confirmation of my years of work experience in the business field along with proof of my business education and I was all set. I‚Äôm officially a certified teacher! I can teach K-12 computers, economics, and business courses.

üìÜ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=379678&mid=5759&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2562126&clickref=" target="_blank">TrustedHousesitters</a> - Travel like a local for less. Exchange pet care for free accommodation.</i><br>

The next step was finding a job overseas so I found a list of international schools overseas. Most schools want 2+ years of experience, but I applied for any economics, computer, or business teacher anyway. I got TWO bites back from a school in M√©xico and one in Venezuela. I was supposed to interview with the school in Venezuela but the guy was over 30 minutes late to the interview and I had to go to work that day. He wasted my time and he can kiss my ass. I did interview with the school in M√©xico, but I never heard anything back from them after the interview.

In the meantime I was also applying to the Teach and Learn in Korea (TaLK) program in South Korea. I gathered up all the documents that cost money: background check, apostille of degree, apostille of background check, transcripts and mailed them in. Had to do two interviews and didn‚Äôt get the job. Sadly I tried in 2013 and didn‚Äôt get anything either. Guess it wasn‚Äôt meant to be plus I didn‚Äôt really want to teach english anyway.

Also, while doing that I was applying to university positions in China. Didn‚Äôt really want to go to China but it‚Äôs super easy to get a job there teaching at a university. Most of the positions would be teaching english which would have been okay with me due to the hours. I would have worked less than 16 hours a week and taught only 8 courses. But I did find a few universities that needed business teachers. They were in shitty locations with high pollution‚Ä¶I turned them down.

I actually accepted an english teaching position in Yunnan province which is the ‚Äúuntouched‚Äù province in China and very beautiful, but got another offer to teach a business course in another province just last week. I felt bad turning the job down because they had already approved me for a work visa. But teaching business courses is my background and what I want to do. I get that experience and I‚Äôm set! I just need to finish up my master‚Äôs and get my CPA‚Ä¶

So I‚Äôll be off to Mianyang, China at the end of August. This article was very encouraging to me. Sigh‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know about going back to the ‚Äúcold‚Äù, but I‚Äôll make it through. A year or two won‚Äôt kill me. I‚Äôm so worried about selling all my stuff before I need to leave. I‚Äôll go back home a week before and fly out of San Francisco.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M&eacute;xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M&eacute;xico City nor even visited M&eacute;xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M&eacute;xico and she is there to stay!
