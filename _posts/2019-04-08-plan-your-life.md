This is the Keen Ready, com Black woman in Mexico podcast with me, Elyse Robinson, coming to you from Mexico City, Mexico, one of the largest cities in the world. I'm here to dispel the myths and rumors about Mexico and also to tell you how to live a great life overseas, I have been living in Mexico City since November 2016. And I truly do love it here. And just to add a disclaimer, these experiences are mine and mine alone, and I can't speak for anyone else.

0:39  
Hey,

0:40  
this is episode number 57. And I'm going to start doing YouTube videos

0:45  
along with

0:47  
the podcast because I can extract

üìÜ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=379678&mid=5759&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2562126&clickref=" target="_blank">TrustedHousesitters</a> - Travel like a local for less. Exchange pet care for free accommodation.</i><br>

0:48  
the audio easily.

0:51  
And it will help my youtube

0:53  
channel too.

0:55  
So you can look at me

0:57  
and you can listen to me if you ride in the car, whatever. But

1:07  
I got some positive negative stuff going on in my life,

1:11  
and shout out to use it for the idea of actually use them as a Christian.

1:18  
I like to do my shout outs and be appreciative to my peoples. For the idea of doing the YouTube

1:26  
cuz, oh, really being on camera, whatever, but

üõ∏ <i><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/elyser93?currency=USD" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> - Get $40 off a home booking of $75 or more and $15 off an experience of $50 or more</i><br>

1:29  
it's the part of my life now.

1:31  
So I gotta man up, as they would say.

1:35  
So

1:38  
we can start off with the negative

1:40  
so negative

1:42  
have a cut somebody on my life because they

1:46  
don't know how to be mature, and act like an adult.

1:49  
And that kind of ties into what this podcast is about. Anyway, so I'm I was just speak on it.

üé† <i><a href="https://skiplagged.com/r/elyser" target="_blank">Skiplagged</a> - Exposing loopholes in airfare pricing to save you money</i><br>

1:55  
Who phone,

1:56  
somebody this affectionate.

1:59  
And

2:00  
I'm just like, not really here for it.

2:02  
Because I'm an adult, like, I'm about my shit. Oh, I don't try to make mistakes. You know, I'm saying

2:11  
you know, I plan my life.

2:14  
My thing you really got time for fuck ups

2:16  
in life, you know what I'm saying? So, app, think about things before I do them.

üõ≥Ô∏è <i><a href="https://www.airfordable.com/referred?referrer=5a68bfc9535a390036c934f7" target="_blank">Airfordable</a> - Want to take a vacation but can't afford to pay for the whole flight right now? Check out Airfordable! Sign up with my link to get $25 off your first flight!</i><br>

2:23  
And

2:27  
that's just it. So, you know,

2:29  
maybe we could have worked it

2:31  
out.

2:32  
But he cherish my feelings.

2:36  
Afterwards, the whole situation was

2:38  
just how he taught us all the and

2:41  
I like that.

2:42  
So yeah, first I say some choice words he crying like that even. I mean, it's true. But

‚õ±Ô∏è <i><a href="https://www.visahq.com/?a_aid=vaff9616" target="_blank">VisaHQ</a> - Help in obtaining your visa if needed</i><br>

2:52  
that's how I was feeling at the time, still feel like that, but don't better. Now, some.

2:59  
Very again, we use him because he puts together these little round tables,

3:05  
every now and then.

3:07  
He says I'm trying to do them once a month or so. And they're, they're fun.

3:13  
And it kept my mind off my little situation that I had

3:15  
on Wednesday.

3:20  
So

3:24  
Thursday,

3:26  
Thursday, my computer cord went out. And so I didn't really I mean,

üöë <i><a href="https://www.sevencorners.com/?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">Seven Corners</a> - Travel/Health insurance in case you get hurt, sick, or lose your luggage</i><br>

3:29  
I have my mother's Mac. And so I don't really like Mac, you shouldn't

3:34  
have to pound three keys just to do something like

3:36  
you don't have carpal tunnel, like I shouldn't have to put my hands like this in order to you know, type on the keyboard.

3:45  
And

3:47  
that's been a real struggle.

3:49  
And hopefully my core

3:50  
comes today they claim is supposed to come today. But

üõ¥ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=385121&mid=11018&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2598552&clickref=" target="_blank">Viator</a> - Get $10 free</i><br>

3:54  
we'll see.

3:56  
Amazon ain't been wrong yet.

3:59  
So it should be here today.

4:01  
And Friday, my electricity went

4:03  
out so little

4:04  
bit about married. So if

4:06  
y'all know about married and Mexico, it gets hot as hell. So somebody told me the guy's got two seasons, warmer and warmer. So every day since the 90s every day, basically,

4:19  
when I moved here in December,

üóø <i><a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/ee4bce1e-84de-4387-a735-d59d04539960" target="_blank">Groupon</a> - Have used this web site for YEARS to find all kinds of deals in multiple cities all over the world.</i><br>

4:21  
the average was about 85 which is perfect. But

4:27  
of course I'm not gonna stay that way.

4:28  
So my juice

4:30  
like what the

4:31  
second week of April.

4:33  
And we

4:34  
the Friday was it got 100 degrees.

4:38  
So

4:39  
it was hot.

4:40  
There's no way I was sitting in my apartment in 100 degree weather because it's always hotter inside

4:46  
your house than it is

4:49  
outside.

4:50  
Actually outside had a nice little breeze and I was just

4:53  
chillin. So I decided to go to Texas Roadhouse.

4:56  
Yes, they had Texas Roadhouse here. There's no reason for me to come back to the States because

5:01  
I have everything I could ever want here.

5:06  
So I got me some chicken

5:07  
critters,

5:08  
some fries, a margarita,

5:11  
some rattlesnake

ü§ê <i><a href="https://baselang.com/signup/?referral=me%40elyserobinson.com" target="_blank">BaseLang</a> - The website I've been using to learn Spanish with unlimited lessons for $149 per month.</i><br>

5:12  
vice ahead, Tom, my life. And then

5:16  
I got engaged with my next door neighbor.

5:17  
And so

5:18  
we're going to teach each other and Spanish and English, so that should be fun, free 99.

5:23  
And so I'm texting him. He's like,

5:25  
Yeah, no, it's not back on. I'm like, Okay, cool. I'm staying out longer.

5:29  
And so I say that's actually about 11 o'clock that

5:32  
night, I had a time I went to my first Mexican casino.

5:38  
They gave

üíé <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=383744&mid=6288&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2587800&clickref=" target="_blank">Fiverr.com</a> - Need a website? fiverr | Need a voice over? fiverr | Need a logo? fiverr</i><br>

5:38  
me 50 pesos free and I played 50 pesos. So that's about $1 50

5:43  
per month, 50

5:44  
pesos. So I spent about 50 and

5:51  
$3 in total.

5:53  
And I'm a member

5:55  
now so I will be going back because

5:57  
it was actually fun. I was I was up a little bit them. I was like well, I'm I just played all

6:03  
yellow. And then

6:06  
I went walking down downtown, which is called El Centro. And

üìÜ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=379678&mid=5759&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2562126&clickref=" target="_blank">TrustedHousesitters</a> - Travel like a local for less. Exchange pet care for free accommodation.</i><br>

6:18  
found this place they do scratches and I haven't had a Mexican scratcher either scratcher lottery ticket. And there are only five pesos. I'm going to start buying them all the time you go see me on the news.

6:31  
La negra has hit the lottery

6:35  
will like 500,000 pesos

6:36  
or something by me little house but I'm

6:42  
about to start playing every week by me late Tony Tony scratches because I did not know that.

6:48  
So and I went twice and the third time I know when nothing so.

6:55  
So that's bad and rode around,

6:57  
had just

6:58  
had to turn my mic clear my mind a lot. I have so much fun.

7:03  
So I mean, Saturday. Like I said, you sort of put together a little round table. And so that

7:09  
topic was conspiracy theories.

7:11  
And basically,

7:12  
I'm speaking on like, the next the hustle thing I know, who knows he has a was until like, a couple weeks

7:20  
ago, when him and his girlfriend,

7:23  
baby mama, whatever you want to call her. Did a photoshoot and I'm like, Okay, what is real? It was really nice. I liked it a lot. And then he comes up dead. So

üé† <i><a href="https://skiplagged.com/r/elyser" target="_blank">Skiplagged</a> - Exposing loopholes in airfare pricing to save you money</i><br>

7:34  
I don't know. And so everybody in the black nice, I'm asking furious theory.

7:42  
Yeah, now, you know,

7:44  
and that leads into the next topic of, you know,

7:49  
planning

7:50  
your life. I know things come up in life, and you can't be born into, you know, the right family, I understand that. So, but there is still some things that you can try to do, you know, to make it make your life better, and to not be in poverty, number one, number two,

8:13  
not to have a hard life. And so

8:18  
those four things are

8:20  
useful gave me this to

8:22  
is to graduate high school

8:25  
is to

8:26  
get married after 21

8:29  
don't have

8:30  
children until you're married and get a full time job. Now the job one is black, cuz I've always wanted to be entrepreneur. And I've been entrepreneur a couple times in my life.

‚õ±Ô∏è <i><a href="https://www.visahq.com/?a_aid=vaff9616" target="_blank">VisaHQ</a> - Help in obtaining your visa if needed</i><br>

8:41  
He tells a story for another day. But

8:47  
as long as you have income, steady income, I suppose

8:49  
that should be all right.

8:53  
So those are the four things you can do in order to it says Matt, the empower me if you do those four things, you have less than a 2% chance

9:01  
of

9:02  
being in poverty. And you have a 74% chance of making into the middle class.

9:08  
We need to talk about college

9:10  
didn't even talk about college. So

üöë <i><a href="https://www.sevencorners.com/?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">Seven Corners</a> - Travel/Health insurance in case you get hurt, sick, or lose your luggage</i><br>

9:15  
So

9:15  
yeah,

9:17  
there's you know, these people that work for the county, this lady, whatever, they

9:20  
only have a high school diploma, they make damn good money.

9:23  
She my parents were two of them.

9:26  
So

9:30  
those

9:30  
are some of the things and so

9:32  
in our Roundtable, you know, since we are x

9:35  
pack immigrants, we talked about it from our

üõ¥ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=385121&mid=11018&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2598552&clickref=" target="_blank">Viator</a> - Get $10 free</i><br>

9:38  
perspective of you know, leaving the country and use of talked about brain drain. And so you don't hear about brain, Jane brain drain from first world countries, I hate using first, second and third world but you know, those are the words that we use.

9:56  
And so brain drain, if you don't know, is what where the best and the brightest leave, you know, they get educated, and they leave the country, their home country and go to a so called better country, and give them all their hard earned labor money and, you know, set up, basically set up their whole life there and they do not come back to help the people that they left behind and up help uplift them. And so, you know,

10:26  
me and my peeps are part of that brain drain.

10:34  
Because we would be considered the best and the brightest, you know, we've taken all our skills, and

10:42  
we not coming back, we can help it, we're not coming back. So

üóø <i><a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/ee4bce1e-84de-4387-a735-d59d04539960" target="_blank">Groupon</a> - Have used this web site for YEARS to find all kinds of deals in multiple cities all over the world.</i><br>

10:49  
our lives are somewhere else.

10:51  
And so that leads back into the conspiracy theory on you know, people think we're crazy. And you know, we're part of the so called they, they and the institution, the powers that be or whatever you want to call them.

11:08  
But no, we just, you know, each one of us session our stories a little bit and

11:13  
how our upbringing and what we did, and you know, outside of unique, I mean, we all graduated from high school shout out to me, because she's actually unique, she got her GED.

11:28  
And another word that kept coming up was hustling, hustling, and critical thinking skills. And so every one of us consider ourselves hustlers like, we have that motivation, we have that, Oh, well, we can't fail.

11:43  
If we do fail, we just dust ourselves off and get right back up again, because you're going to fail. This is the part of life

11:50  
we don't get defeated easily. We have the drive to be successful to be something great, greater than so

‚öì <i><a href="https://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=1953880" target="_blank">Booking.com</a> - Get 20% off hotels</i><br>

12:04  
we talked about that in the YouTube video.

12:11  
And we also talk about

12:15  
why people stagnate, why they can't get their

12:17  
shit together.

12:19  
And shout out to Roxanna she was on there, too.

12:23  
And we came down to one, one simple thing, or at work, a couple simple things,

12:29  
that people

ü§ê <i><a href="https://baselang.com/signup/?referral=me%40elyserobinson.com" target="_blank">BaseLang</a> - The website I've been using to learn Spanish with unlimited lessons for $149 per month.</i><br>

12:30  
don't plan their lives, it was used to have, again, that told me if you don't play in your life, someone else will.

12:38  
And that there's certain things, you know, naming off these things, again, web, you know, having a child early wedlock, you know, not graduating high school, my not working

12:51  
there, so check boxes that you need to check

12:53  
in, you know, don't deviate from that, because it makes your life so much more difficult.

13:01  
So people have a bad foundation start now. And then they're like, Well, number one, they start to blame. Other people said themselves, I mean, you know, birth control been around for Wow. So you know,

13:17  
that's one of the the, the,

üíé <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=383744&mid=6288&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2587800&clickref=" target="_blank">Fiverr.com</a> - Need a website? fiverr | Need a voice over? fiverr | Need a logo? fiverr</i><br>

13:20  
the

13:20  
obstacles there. And

13:25  
the last

13:25  
thing was basically what we can do to help and so, you know, it came all the way

13:29  
full circle

13:30  
unique again, because, you know,

13:36  
where the where the drain brain drain people. And, you know, what are we doing to you know, reach back and help other people. And I have my business via phone or calm, but I can't do it for free, you know, I can't do it for free, I got

13:51  
to live to.

13:56  
And so people don't invest in themselves.

üìÜ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=379678&mid=5759&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2562126&clickref=" target="_blank">TrustedHousesitters</a> - Travel like a local for less. Exchange pet care for free accommodation.</i><br>

14:00  
People

14:02  
don't take their lives seriously, they want you to co sign their bullshit. And Roxanna is you know, saying that people come to her and went to Mexico or, you know, here, whatever.

14:11  
And they don't have no kind

14:13  
of plan, know,

14:15  
kind of plan and she's like, Okay, well, let me help you make a plan. And so they're like, No, no,

14:19  
no, no,

14:21  
I got it. I'm just, I'm just being fucking nosy.

14:28  
And I want you to cosine my bullshit.

14:32  
That's just not how that works.

14:34  
And my mother used to tell me all the time when I was younger, you know,

üõ∏ <i><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/elyser93?currency=USD" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> - Get $40 off a home booking of $75 or more and $15 off an experience of $50 or more</i><br>

14:37  
I've paid attention, but

14:43  
just now, realizing some stuff.

14:47  
Do not reinvent the wheel. And so reinventing the wheel. I mean, the wheel was created

14:54  
thousands of years ago, you know,

14:57  
no one has ever improved on the wheel is doesn't need to be improved on, you don't need to make it out of gold or silver. You don't need to make a triangle or square, it ain't gonna work. So do not reinvent something that has already been laid out for you. And that's

15:13  
where

üé† <i><a href="https://skiplagged.com/r/elyser" target="_blank">Skiplagged</a> - Exposing loopholes in airfare pricing to save you money</i><br>

15:14  
my business comes into play. And that's where all the rest of the ex pats come

15:18  
into play.

15:21  
And people don't listen.

15:24  
So

15:28  
we just came to the conclusion that there is no hell, you know,

15:33  
you have to listen and take criticism and to take help and to trust people. And most people just will will not

15:41  
be just will not.

15:42  
And then they, you know, they want to blame someone else. Usually you

15:52  
own up to you bullshit,

15:54  
as that criticism of self correction, is that something that has already been laid out for you Listen.

16:03  
Um, so,

16:07  
yeah,

16:09  
I don't want to beat a dead horse. But that's basically what we talked about in the YouTube video.

16:16  
Oh, there's my Amazon package.

16:21  
Everyone go get off my podcast.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
