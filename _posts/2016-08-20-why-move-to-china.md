My reasoning for going overseas is I got tired of the 40+ hour work weeks and non-existent savings. When I read online that people overseas were banking $1,000+ a month and traveling the world I fell out my seat. I can live somewhere virtually free and still do what I love. I won't be able to see my family as easily, but I wasn't really seeing them that much anyway considering I live nowhere near them. My progress was being blocked by my current job so I walked out (literally lol). I have life goals and I believe another country will help me reach them faster.

I first tried in 2013 when I worked for the IRS and the whole government sequestration was going on. They docked 3 days of my pay and the government shutdown for 12 days (I got back paid though for that). I realized this country was crumbling into pieces and tried to go to South Korea on their <a href="https://epik.kr/">EPIK</a> program. I went through the motions and collected the documents but I didn't get a position. I also got a teaching position in China but my mother refused to let me go. So I didn't go...

Fast forward 3 more years...still working for the feds and entrenched in a career. That itch came back again. Plus I wasn't getting the support I needed and wanted in my current job. My current job gave me the skills to stand up in front of people and lecture without fear so I'll give that to them. So I started looking at teaching again, but this time I had more experience, was older, and wiser. I applied again to the EPIK program but they rejected me.

I also got my K-12 teaching license as Arizona makes it SO easy to get one if you're career field is in business. I'm eligible to teach K-12 in computers, economics, and business. FYI another state that makes it easy is Massachusetts. These are the only two states I know of that gives out teaching licenses without completing student teaching. After obtaining my license, I started looking for a teaching position teaching in accounting, economics, or computers. I must have applied to every international school in the world with open positions. Out of 500+ applications I only got one interview at a school in M&eacute;xico and a few bites but nothing came of it. I just didn't have the experience and I'm not willing to obtain it in the US first. Guess the Lord was trying to tell me K-12 teaching was NOT for me.

I gave up on K-12 and started to pursue university positions. Another thing is I should have been done with my master's in accounting this year, but this job hindered me so much. I'll now be completing it next year. I was offered positions teaching english but I didn't want to teach english and kept pushing on. A few universities offered me a position teaching business courses but they didn't offer housing or I didn't get a good vibe (lying). The university I'll be working at had good reviews and their contract was in depth and fair.

My original choice for a country would have never been China, but they make it so easy to get over and get started. I plan on finishing my masters, gain experience teaching at a university in my field, and move on from there. I understand the challenges I will go through...cultural, language barries, racism, sexism, etc etc and I believe I'm prepared for it.

And once again I started this blog to encourage my Black brothers and sisters to go out and explore the world. Break the stereotype of ‚ÄúBlack folks don‚Äôt do this or that‚Äù‚Ä¶

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M&eacute;xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M&eacute;xico City nor even visited M&eacute;xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M&eacute;xico and she is there to stay!
