<h4><i>Public Service Announcement for Women Only</i> üë©üèø</h4><br>
I'm finding there are many women that have never heard of the menstrual cup! I find this sad as I love the menstrual cup and gave up on pads when I moved to Mexico.

<strong>Why did I give up on pads?</strong> Every pad in Mexico (that I have found anyway) is scented! That is not good for your lady bits. Can you imagine when I made my first trip back home, me standing in line buying 10 packs of pads to last me for a while? The lady at Walmart thought I was insane. I explained to her that I live in Mexico and they only have scented pads available and I'm not wearing those. Customs probably thought something was wrong too as they always check my luggage.

<strong>What does the cup do?</strong> The cup (for short) catches your blood just like a pad but doesn't have any harmful chemicals. It's just a small cup you stick up there to catch your blood. You HAVE TO BE 110% comfortable with your body and blood because you will touch yourself to get it in. You fold it up and stick it in, twist it one good time, and you can leave it in for 8-10 hours (if you're sleeping and out and about). It's easy enough to put in and take out without spilling (at least for me and other women I've talked to). Then you just wash it out with soap and water in the sink or shower. They are reusable and last for years but I buy a new one every year. Boil it once in a while to make sure it's still good and clean though. They usually come in two sizes small and large...small for non-child bearing and large for those that have had kids. There are all different types of brands...the most famous one being the <a href="https://amzn.to/2U7lWxc" target="_blank">Diva Cup</a>. I've tried the <a href="https://amzn.to/2U7lWxc" target="_blank">Diva Cup</a> but it hurt putting it in and out for me so I switched to <a href="https://amzn.to/2Yeu1zz" target="_blank">Lena</a> (shown below). You also can't beat the price as you buy it once and the cost is done for a year. I also never notice it's in like pads and they are not uncomfortable at all. It sits about 2-3 inches in there and does not go all the way up there at all.

<strong>How do you use it?</strong> It's easy enough to put in and take out without spilling (at least for me and other women I've talked to). But it might take you a few tries to get it just right AND you need to find the right brand for your lady bits. When you take it out, you just wash it with soap and water in the sink or shower. I also never notice it's in like pads and they are not uncomfortable at all. It sits about 2-3 inches in there and does not go all the way up there at all.

<strong>Extra Information</strong>. They are reusable and last for years but I buy a new one every year. Boil it once in a while to make sure it's still good and clean though. They usually come in two sizes small and large. Small for non-child bearing and large for those that have had kids.

You also can't beat the price as you buy it once and the cost is done for a year. This option also saves the environment by not throwing anything in the garbage and the cost can't be beat compared to buying pads every month.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
