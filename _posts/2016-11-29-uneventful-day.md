Nothing really to report yesterday or today for that matter. Yesterday I had an interview for an Auditor position back in the US and same for today. I also had a short interview for an English teaching position in Colombia yesterday for a summer start date. Between the two interviews I had today, I've just been filling out job applications for telecommuting jobs. I have a few of those interviews coming up as well.

Yesterday I just walked to the store grabbed some fruit and ate dinner at the same restaurant my host took me to the other day. I went there because I know the food is good and I didn't get sick last time. I had a delicious melon agua....tasted like Koolaid. Didn't get lost this time!

I also washed clothes BY HAND! Guess living without a washer and dryer for the few weeks I was back at home helped me. I now hand wash my clothes and hang them up to dry. I've learned the art of layering so my clothes can dry quickly in the sun. That thick sweater I had on when I got her no bueno. I WILL NOT be wearing any more thick clothes.

I went nowhere today and feel bad about it. BUT I was productive in applying for jobs so not all was lost.

I'll be going back to the store tomorrow as I need a few things to make my life complete. I SO NEED to find a mattress topper. I'll see if I can find a mattress store or something because I'm crying over here with my bad hips.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
