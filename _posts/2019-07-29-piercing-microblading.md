This is episode number 62. And like I said in my previous podcast, I've been getting my life all the way together between health and just all the way improving myself. And so for the HH and right now is so

0:27  
I got my eyebrows done recently.

0:30  
So I've had tattoo eyebrows since I was maybe 20 years

0:35  
old. So

üé† <i><a href="https://skiplagged.com/r/elyser" target="_blank">Skiplagged</a> - Exposing loopholes in airfare pricing to save you money.</i><br>

0:36  
I've had them for a very long time. So what 12 years now? And so yeah, I think I was about 2020 ish. Around that time when I got them done. Basically, my mom never had eyebrows she was damn near like will be she had like a little bit. So I don't know who she talks too, about getting tattooed eyebrows. And so she went and got her is dead. And she was like, why don't you repeat your thing because years, I've always had eyebrows, but they was, you know, sparse, you know, like, nobody would be like, Oh my gosh, she's horrifying because she has no eyebrows. And so she finally talked me into getting them done. And I loved it. I loved it. I went to this old or Filipina lady lady. And she also did eyeliner and getting your lips colored and stuff. I'm not going to go that far, but it's definitely an option. And so once the her got them done stuff and you know loved it. They've never last long for me. I think the longest I've went is like three, four years. And so the last time I got him touched up was in 16 I got to add to the game by some some lady. I went to her house got him then I didn't particularly like that job because she obviously didn't know what she was doing because I still had little dots missing. I mean, you know, you can't be 100% perfect, but the Filipino lady, you know, she hooked me all the way up. So that I think I had a group on you know, so I mean, you can't really say anything about a Groupon. I think I paid like $185 for this last time.

2:31  
So

2:33  
since they were looking, you know, spotty, I went and got micro bleeding. I really want it tattoo to stay consistent, but they don't have tattooing here. I actually got a recommendation from someone here. And I went to the lady on Sunday, and got them done. And as you can see, I got you know the cream on them. So I'm greasy up here.

2:57  
And

2:59  
yeah, see my

3:02  
see my, my new eyebrows. I love them. They were supposed to be thinner, but I wanted them thicker. So that's bad. I really liked them. They'll get lighter as as I go along, I gotta go get one more touch up. Because they they fill them in, you know, and then they do another touch of so microblogging is just a blade that they take in do little lines in you and then put

ink over it, like push it into your skin.

3:36  
I actually might go get certified Madame self know.

3:40  
The process is ridiculously easy compared to being tattooed. So you know, you don't need much equipment, that's for sure. Because with tattooing, you need a tattoo gun and all the other stuff. She basically just cut lines in my eyebrows and

3:58  
put the the gone it. And that was it. I was like, oh, okay, that's real simple. Um,

4:07  
she know me up for about 20 minutes before she did me, thank goodness, because I don't know what's going on with the left side of my face with the left side of my face hurt like hell, even though she numbed it up. The right side was I've really felt nothing. But this left side is special, like my left side of my face is real special. It's more sensitive than my right side, obviously, because this one hurt. And I was like

üöë <i><a href="https://www.sevencorners.com/?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">Seven Corners</a> - Travel/Health insurance in case you get hurt, sick, or lose your luggage</i><br>

4:36  
the cost was 2500 pesos, which is about $130 or so.

4:44  
In the States, micro bleeding can go for $600,000. Okay, so I'm getting over here, you might be able to find a Groupon for a little bit more than what I paid. But who knows about the quality here, you can get it cheaper, I've seen it for 1500 paces, but they did not specialize in micro bleeding. So I did not go with them. And plus this lady was recommended to me so I just went with her. And she got me and on a Sunday I was in and out within maybe an hour and a half. And I was done. But I do have to go for another touch of like I said, some and then the next thing I haven't gotten done so I have my greens you know, often enough maybe once a month or so. And so I don't like taking drugs because I'm the type of person that get addicted easily to painkillers because my whole body hurts basically half the time. So I try not to take painkillers I try to do other things to minimize the pain like eat right exercise and things like that. So drink nothing water and wine. And so you know, I don't like to take painkillers where I literally just suffered, I'll suffer through it and just lay in the bed with the lights off. And just in goes in go to sleep that usually helps. So I got me a piercing outside of my ears. I got my first piercing. Right there. Can you see it and that's called a date. If I'm saying the right date piercing, I'm supposed to have a migraines. So I shall see in the next month or so if it helps. Because like I said, I get them pretty often. So I just wanted to do a short little video on that. And the short short podcast on that. And that's basically it. Oh, I could talk more about the piercing. So the piercing, um, I got a recommendation for that because I just don't want to go to anywhere you know, they might not be clean or whatever. Right and so I got two recommendations I said the same place and plus this place got tons of reviews, I got all kinds of likes. So somebody's going there. I got another recommendation for another place but I didn't go there. So I you know I got the price before I left and I chopped played me on a price that's the first time or somebody ever tried to play me on a price here in Mexico. So I got the price do say to 290 pesos do when I walked in and he was like 350 pesos I'm like Nope,

7:40  
that's not what I got pulled it

7:42  
up on the phone. He's like, let me go talk to somebody you do that now like it was gonna matter anyways because I mean, he wasn't really about to charge me 350 pesos that's what she wasn't trying to do. So now what you want to talk to somebody about stuff I walk in there and stuff and I paid and then these I come up to upstairs and he got he showed me the needle that it was clean in the pack. And he marked my ear Where is supposed to go. And then he took the needle and just poked it through the arrows. It hurt. I will say it didn't hurt but it was in you know cry heard it was just like a little pinch. I guess it wasn't that bad at all. And he stuck the earring in there and it was less than less than five minute process. And so you told me I just need to get some sailing solution rinse it out and stuff and keep it clean. I can use soap and water to wash it and for about a month and I should be good. So I'm excited to do this because I've been wanting for a long time and I was just number one scared and number two

9:01  
it wasn't really on my list of things to be trying to do.

9:06  
So filling there in you know, I got my eyebrows done, got my ear done. So I'm in the zone. I'm in the zone. I'm doing daring shit right now. So I just want to do like I said a quick video on that and
