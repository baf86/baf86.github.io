My second day was much, much better. My <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/elyser93?currency=USD">AirBnB</a> host came over and brought me fresh squeezed orange juice...it was HEAVEN. We decided to meet up at noon so she could show me around the neighborhood. I LOVE the neighborhood I live in...especially after I got lost and no one bothered me lol. There are all kinds of markets and stores around me within walking distance. We went to lunch at a delicious restaurant where I had chicken enchiladas. They were so good except they were lukewarm.

I SO miss living like this as I lived like that in Los Angeles (Pasadena) where everything is within walking distance. She showed me Starbucks, Carl's Jr, Little Caesar's (yuck), a gym, a bank, a pharmacy, gas station, and a beautiful church. After doing all that walking I was tired! I was also supposed to meet up with the guy that saved me but I was just too tired to come out so I shall meet up with him today.

I also found my favorite wine. Yea don't judge me I love the cheap stuff...good ol Barefoot Sweet Red wine. I was ecstatic!

I plan to go back to the store and get some more food and hopefully find a mattress topper plus a few other things. Check out the pictures below!

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to MÃ©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of MÃ©xico City nor even visited MÃ©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in MÃ©xico and she is there to stay!
