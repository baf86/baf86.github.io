I have a lot to talk about...

I successfully moved into my new apartment. My new neighborhood is very nice, clean, not too busy, there's a train station right up the street, lots of food places, convenience stores, grocery store, and tons of professionals walking around and grabbing a bite to eat. I believe this is it for me! I also just found out today I get a weekly maid to clean my apartment and wash my clothes. I'm so happy lol. Of course my rent went up by $180 but it's worth it to be in a better area and I'm much, much closer to the action.

While I was in Houston I tried for my residence visa with no luck. The woman wanted to see business bank statements which I didn't think to bring. I had my personal bank statements! I also brought my business documents but the consulate lady wasn't having it. Sigh...I think next time I will go to another consulate. I was THIS close!

I went to Moody Gardens in Galveston, TX with my family and had a blast! They have this rain forest exhibit where you are actually walking around inside with the wild animals. It was scary but fun at the same time. I saw a huge lizard eat a rat...I JUST missed getting a pic of it. I had the most delicious cat fish and tilapia I've had in my life. I'm still thinking about it! There was a tornado VERY near to where my sister lived and I was scared to death. So I've added living through a tornado to my life's list. It stormed so bad it flooded in parts of Houston. The rain just ran like a faucet most of the time I was there.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
