So after being in China for a little bit, it made me realize I need to learn a language or two if I'm going to be competitive in this world. It sucked going everywhere and not knowing what the simplest of things said. I was scared to get certain things at the grocery store because I had no idea what it said. My next trip I'll be heading to Ecuador to learn Spanish for 3 months. I'll be leaving next month as I need to make sure everything is alright with my family first.

I found a private tutor that comes highly recommended for 20 hours per week for $8/hour. So $160/week for language lessons. I rented an apartment on <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/c/elyser93">AirBnB.com</a> for $211/month total cost of $635 after fees. I'll be flying United straight through to Quito with no layovers for a cost of $542. I'll just have to buy food, transportation, and whatever activities I want to do. They use the dollar so no exchanging money.

I'm super excited and I've been joking with my dad that I'll be able to press 2 on the phone when I come back.

I also wanted to hop over to Brazil to learn Portuguese since it's relatively easy to learn after Spanish but I need to apply for a visa there's no easy way to get there from Quito. A flight back there would be $800+ and just not worth it. Maybe I can take up some Skype classes to add another language to my resume.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to MÃ©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of MÃ©xico City nor even visited MÃ©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in MÃ©xico and she is there to stay!
