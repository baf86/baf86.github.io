This is episode number 80. And my name is Elise Robinson, a black American woman and lives in Mexico.

0:09  
Why did I live in Mexico?

0:12  
My mother passed away from blood cancer in November 2016. So I quit my whole life to take care of her and my family. And so

0:21  
at that point, I didn't have anything left.

üöó <i><a href="https://www.uber.com/invite/elyser416ui" target="_blank">Uber</a> - Try Uber with a free ride!</i>

0:25  
And so, I left, I decided

0:28  
I was going to leave the country to mourn into

0:32  
to explore, you know,

0:36  
on a new life,

üåª <i><a href="https://www.printful.com/start-your-online-store-without-inventory/a/1854514:450bfe266f4da83c5d4941174baf6d27" target="_blank">Printful</a> - Become an online entrepreneur and start an online store without inventory</i>

0:38  
and so I found it in Mexico.

0:41  
I moved to Mexico City, you always hear about Cordova, yakka and Cabo and Cancun. So I'd never heard of Mexico City. I had never even stepped foot in Mexico, even though I lived on the border to Weiss. And so I have the Southwest Airlines fly with points which Mexico City was the cheapest and the rest is history. I've been here almost four years.

1:09  
I caught my father one time I was never coming back home.

2:42

3:00  
up on me as more human now.

3:02  
So I don't really know what to do at this point Um, and I cannot get an appointment to go see a pulmonologist. I'm actually I'm gonna try again tomorrow and see if I can get an appointment because I haven't tried to spend a month it's been a month so I will try again tomorrow and see if I can get an appointment cuz

3:30  
Yeah, I got a new symptom at this point my lungs

3:34  
started burning me last night, like burnin kind of my big gas because I had some plant stains and I looked up if they look great, they can give you gas and I was bourbon a little bit but I'm not 1,000% sure at this point because it kind of burned me now but I did have some planting. So I'll see. Um I thought I might have had to go to the hostel Spittal not last night but the night before.

4:04  
So yeah, we hopped in Uber and

4:10  
poco magma pump.

4:12  
It just takes forever in my mind for it to work and then I also have anxiety so anxiety will have you not being able to breathe in your mind to.

4:23  
So

4:26  
yeah,

üí≥ <i><a href="https://www.acorns.com/invite/A4ZAYK" target="_blank">Acorns</a> - Get $5 free to start investing now</i>

4:28  
be panicking for no reason so told the Uber driver to go back home take them back home. But I did see that everything is blocked off. Unfortunately, if there really was emergency, I'll probably take a while to get there. And that ain't that ain't something you want to happen at this point. Um, but yeah, they have caution tape everywhere everywhere. It was around 1130 at night so not to say the restaurants wouldn't be open because a lot of them Things don't open until like six o'clock seven o'clock here because of the heat. But everything just looks dated. Today there was some some to man out cook and tacos, trying to sell them but I mean Mexico is the under the word of hustle in a dictionary so so yeah. And plus Mexico is huge on day labor. So they probably needed the money. Um, the heat here is ridiculous. It's been like 108 give or take every day for weeks now four days. So that isn't helping with the fires number one, because we have fires because

üí∞ <i><a href="https://join.robinhood.com/elyser17" target="_blank">Robinhood</a> - Want a FREE stock? Valued up to $1,000</i>

5:52  
of being so dry and no rain.

5:56  
But I did

5:58  
go outside today. Early this morning I got my wish that I've been praying for which was

6:08  
some rain and drizzle a little bit.

6:12  
So I figured that cleared

‚õ∏Ô∏è <i><a href="https://www.rakuten.com/r/YOURS219?eeid=28187" target="_blank">Rakuten</a> - Earn cashback for shopping online</i>

6:13  
up the smoke that cleared up the pollen a little bit. I decided to go outside. So is my sign that you know everything was good because I hoped and wished and prayed for it and I eventually got it. I did run into a couple people outside I went out it was about 737 45 ish. Had my mask on, as you can see from my my video pitcher asked me it was strange. I went to the main road to see the buses were still running. And they obviously are because it was a man sitting out there and I did see a collect TiVo which is basically like a fan that takes you to the same places. The buses will take the bus smaller

7:01  
faster and quicker.

7:03  
I got home dad

7:06  
we got honked at so

7:10  
we'll be going to the Main Street anymore

7:13  
won't be going to the main street because I'm not trying to be out here being seen. So I will just walk around in my neighborhood Excuse me. So those pertains um one reason outside of my asthma why I don't want to come outside is because I'm not to say that I look like an American because people don't think I'm American 99.9% of the time. Here I am Cuban or belizian. So, American is like the last thing that they think I am But those that know I am American or would speculate that I am that could potentially pose problems. I have heard in other countries I have heard in other cities not necessarily where I live of them not wanting Americans around because we are the largest country with the most cases and the most deaths and everything else that goes along with it. So am Plus, you know, I haven't gotten my 1200 dollars because I don't know what's going on with that. But I got my $200 but $200 is a lot of money. And you know, I could potentially come up, Rob kidnap Who the hell knows. So that's another reason why I have been in the house. so damn. 26 I finally broke my quarantine and

decided to bring my black ass out

9:09  
and get some sun which was

9:22  
my front office lady is telling me

9:24  
not to bring my black ass outside

9:29  
she said that someone died about 45 minutes from here yesterday and that they couldn't get the body which makes sense because suppose the device contagious so they're not going to give it to the family to bury and do whatever they want to do with it right? I don't know if they're burning bodies here or hurry burying them here.

here attacking healthcare workers, which I've heard stories in America to have people coming up not attacked but you know verbally abused. My sister is a healthcare worker and I've told her specifically do not leave the hospital with your scrubs on and be out and about with them on because people are crazy out here. They have been attacking healthcare workers they don't want them around. I don't understand the logic on that. But okay. I have also been threatening to burn down hospitals because they don't want them in their neighborhoods with the infected people is crazy. Mexico is in phase three. Basically they're trying to they're they're saying it's uh, trying to control it. Tell people to stay in the house because if we overload the hospitals, then that is the most serious problem and I don't think people understand that is that the reason why they want us to stay in the house is not because people are getting infected is because they don't want to overload the healthcare system. So because if people have well the health care system then won't be enough help so

12:07  
stay in house

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
