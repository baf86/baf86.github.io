Searched for a bit on Expedia. I wanted a hotel that was close to the airport so I could just get off the plane and lay my head on a pillow within a hour of landing. I also wanted a clean hotel, shuttle from the airport to the hotel, and staff that spoke English. So I had to spend quite a bit to check off those things on the list. I chose <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/cn/langham-place-beijing-capital-airport.xu.html?aid=1953880&no_rooms=1&group_adults=2" target="_blank">Langham Place Beijing Capital Airport</a> which is right next to the airport and provides a shuttle.

I used a $25 off coupon I received from Expedia for booking through their app. The original price with taxes and fees was $156.76. I paid $131.76 with the coupon. So my trip planning is pretty much complete. I'm now researching their phone plans so I can make calls cheaply soon as I get off the plane.

And my mother is finally coming home today...she is getting better. God is good.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M&eacute;xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M&eacute;xico City nor even visited M&eacute;xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M&eacute;xico and she is there to stay!
