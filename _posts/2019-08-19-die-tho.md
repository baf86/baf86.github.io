This is episode number 63. Can't believe I have that many AOI been all kinds of raggedy skin is jacked. I had a infection and my asthma, my asthma my asthma has been kicking my ass. My lungs don't want to work with me.

0:26  
I need to order me some nettle leaf team.

0:29  
So as soon as I get off this video, that's what I'm going to do. I suppose.

0:35  
The nettle leaf tea is a natural anti histamine and it helped me tremendously when I live in Arizona with the dry heat and now I'm in a little bit of humidity and

0:48  
it just it ain't working with me.

‚õ±Ô∏è <i><a href="https://www.visahq.com/?a_aid=vaff9616" target="_blank">VisaHQ</a> - Help in obtaining your visa if needed</i><br>

0:51  
So the air infection

0:55  
I guess due to my allergies, how one of my right ear and

1:00  
So around Friday ish

1:04  
I started having pain in my ear and so

1:08  
I was like okay, I think I might have an ear infection. So it didn't go away. It didn't go away at all. So Monday I got up and went to the free clinic. So they have doctors at the pharmacies here

1:24  
that are free free 99

1:27  
and he checked my ears out wrote a prescription and got my ear drops and I was in and out and less than 10 minutes

üöë <i><a href="https://www.sevencorners.com/?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">Seven Corners</a> - Travel/Health insurance in case you get hurt, sick, or lose your luggage</i><br>

1:38  
that your drops or about $7 or so and the air drops eight my ears the hell up. So now I have to heal the inside and outside of my ears. Because that's one of the side effects burnt burnt off skin.

1:55  
So like I'm kind of repeat on this all jack that my skin is just

2:00  
Is ain't been working with me. I don't know what to do, I did go get a facial so it looks like it's it's gotten a little bit better,

2:09  
less breakouts, I don't know what to do because I, I my skin was perfect before this, it was literally perfect. And then when I woke up one day and it was just, it was just acne to and it is Friday night in the world but it just asked me to

üõ¥ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=385121&mid=11018&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2598552&clickref=" target="_blank">Viator</a> - Get $10 free</i><br>

2:25  
I don't know what to do. And as for this as my mind, I will wake up out of a dead sleep

2:33  
and I can't breathe. And then I have to get my asthma pump and freaked out and call the ambulance and you know all the other jazz and I talked about on my last podcast. So I don't really know what to do at this point.

2:49  
I just had to take a day by day and take care of myself Of course.

2:56  
So the topic today is

üóø <i><a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/ee4bce1e-84de-4387-a735-d59d04539960" target="_blank">Groupon</a> - Have used this web site for YEARS to find all kinds of deals in multiple cities all over the world.</i><br>

3:00  
Did you die though? And so there's a there's a good article

3:06  
first from

3:08  
Yahoo News, Yahoo News, and so

3:13  
it talks about white people, the irony of them leaving the country because they're scared of the gun violence, the irony, right? The real irony. And so these white people are moving to

3:29  
Poland, Spain and Costa Rica, Australia. So

3:36  
they're getting they're getting a fuck out of dodge.

‚öì <i><a href="https://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=1953880" target="_blank">Booking.com</a> - Get 20% off hotels</i><br>

3:40  
So shout out to Veneta because we had a little short discussion on my page about you know, most people are not going to leave

3:51  
because they scared and so that's why my my title is but did you die though? And so my whole thing

4:00  
Outside of nothing is promising you only live one says but did you die though because, you know as long as you didn't die

4:09  
alone we add on as long as you're still healthy you know because if you you know you broke a leg or and you know you have no legs anymore It could present problems but

4:20  
even then, you know there's there's amazing people on this earth doing a damn thing.

4:28  
And so my whole thing is, as long as you didn't die you have another day, another hour, another minutes. Another second to make everything right and complete and how you how you want to live your life. And so

4:44  
I know people get scared.

4:47  
I like to say I don't get scared anymore because I mean, with all the things I've been through and all the things that I've done in my life what what would I have to be scared of at this point? Oh, I have nothing to

5:00  
To be scared of

5:05  
and to reiterate my story for probably the thousand thousand time, and I know there's 1000 thousand time

5:15  
to flight to Mexico see knew nothing about this city. Mary reheard of the city. I didn't know anyone here and I sure as hell didn't speak Spanish can understand a word in Spanish.

5:30  
And so people get on me all the time, you know, you should be scared of something is get another and like shit still here and kicking at this point.

üíé <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=383744&mid=6288&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2587800&clickref=" target="_blank">Fiverr.com</a> - Need a website? fiverr | Need a voice over? fiverr | Need a logo? fiverr</i><br>

5:42  
And

5:45  
you know, when I go I don't want to have any regrets I do I do what I want to do when I want to do it. And so

5:54  
you get over that fear real quick. When you've been through some things and when you've done certain things

6:00  
And, you know, I have another podcast or to talk about people not everyone should move overseas and that is true because I've seen some stuff. I've seen some shit. I've heard of some shit. And you know, I don't want people to go through that.

6:20  
But at the end of the day

6:26  
but did you die though and you know, survival, survival of the fittest and you know, most people want to live and survive, so, you're going to do whatever it takes to, to,

üìÜ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=379678&mid=5759&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2562126&clickref=" target="_blank">TrustedHousesitters</a> - Travel like a local for less. Exchange pet care for free accommodation.</i><br>

6:39  
to do that.

6:41  
And I try not to be scared of love, you know, adventures, moving somewhere, doing certain things, taking risks, scare money, don't make money, all that.

6:54  
All that because I want to be happy. I want you know, to be a chance and

7:00  
Happiness, complete happiness. And that's one reason why I started be a foreigner because people were not happy with their lives. And you know, another thing people like to say is moving to a new destination won't help. And that's a lie. That's a lie because I've been a couple situations in my life where we went to a new place helped me tremendously

üé† <i><a href="https://skiplagged.com/r/elyser" target="_blank">Skiplagged</a> - Exposing loopholes in airfare pricing to save you money.</i><br>

7:25  
screaming to the day I die then Mexico City changed my life and I'm forever grateful for for Mexico City.

7:35  
And so be a foreigner helps with that we're trying to find people opportunities to move overseas.

7:44  
And so again, who did you dad though, you know, people, he was scared of shit there just to make a bit of damn sense at the time. Like, you know, as long as you still breathing and kicking, go ahead and do it. Just do it.

8:01  
You can always you can always start over. You know, I know people don't like to start over but sometimes it's just a part of life shit I didn't start over a couple of times in my life. And that ain't even that ain't even an issue name is scary anymore.

8:18  
And I'll probably I'll probably start over once more because I want to go back to Mexico City. So

8:27  
that's what I'm have to do start over.

8:33  
But just add a little tidbit. The difference between these other countries in and the United States is they have furnished housing so everything that's in my apartment is outside of my clothes pretty much and my Electronics is is not mine. I won't be taking it with me.

8:53  
I wish the United States would

8:56  
get into that more it would. It would help out a lot.

9:00  
would help out a lot. But, you know, the United States was built on capitalism and free labor.

9:09  
free labor, if that's what you want to call it, so everything's greed, greed, greed.

‚õ±Ô∏è <i><a href="https://www.visahq.com/?a_aid=vaff9616" target="_blank">VisaHQ</a> - Help in obtaining your visa if needed</i><br>

9:15  
So yeah, when you move to these other countries, I mean, you can, you don't even have to buy anything. You just bring your suitcase with you and go about your business. And that's what makes it easier to leave and start over. That's what you want to call it.

9:32  
Just Just add that little tidbit because i don't i don't think a lot of people know and understand that. These places are just just different on so many levels, which can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it. For me, that's a good thing.

9:51  
But

9:53  
people are scared of the most insignificant things. And so that's why I created this, this part.

10:00  
caste one because you know to give encouragement to people that's on the fence, you know? Did you die though? No, you didn't. So you have another day another hour another minute another seconds to

10:17  
to make your life better.

üöë <i><a href="https://www.sevencorners.com/?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">Seven Corners</a> - Travel/Health insurance in case you get hurt, sick, or lose your luggage</i><br>

10:20  
As for

10:23  
what's going on outside of me being sickly

10:28  
I haven't even been sick like one time outside of damn food poisoning in Mexico City. So this is a new shift for me. It's got me kind of upset because, you know, I haven't been speaking a couple years. Only time I get sick is when I go back to the States. The garbage is food, air and water. So it's like as soon as I step off the airplane, I'm coughing and pollutants, as my grandma was saying.

10:51  
So um,

10:54  
yeah, I don't know what to think of this at this point, but I'm gonna give me some nettle leaf tea and see if that works.

11:00  
For anything else that's going on my life, I'm just focusing on my business, my health and

üõ¥ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=385121&mid=11018&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2598552&clickref=" target="_blank">Viator</a> - Get $10 free</i><br>

11:11  
being being happy in my happy place called Mexico. So

11:17  
I'm

11:21  
little encouragement for those people. That's that's scared of whatever it is you scared in life, you know? Just Just remember as long as you ain't dead, you gotta you got another opportunity to make it right and to fix it.

11:38  
Adios, amigos
