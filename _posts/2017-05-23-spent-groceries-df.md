I used to get my groceries delivered back in the US. I got them delivered in Los Angeles and Tucson, AZ.

When I lived in LA I found out about a company called Instacart and fell in love! A "personal shopper" would go and pick out your groceries for you and deliver them. What I loved most about them is they would call you if they didn't have an item in stock and ask if you wanted to substitute. This came in handy because I have osteoarthritis in my hips which makes it hard to do a lot of things, I hate grocery shopping with a passion, and I could buy more things than hauling my little cart with me to the store as I didn't drive. The service fee was not more than $10, a small price to pay for such convenience.

It was a bit different when I lived in Tucson. Of course, they did not have Instacart (small town living) so I used Safeway Delivery. It was not personalized at all but they had the option of automatically giving you items to substitute with if your brand or item was not available. A huge delivery truck would make its rounds for the day delivering customer's orders. I did not like that I had to order the day before and could never order the day of. I also utilized Walmart Pick Up as I did drive in Tucson. I would order my groceries AND household products on Thursday and pick them up on Friday. It was a very handy service.

Anyhoo what am I getting at? Mexico has grocery and household product delivery! I brought back my blender and slow cooker/pressure cooker combo and will be cooking more. I'm just spending WAY too much one eating out every day. My first meal last week was Black Bean Soup. I ordered again yesterday to have Chicken Tacos (yes I'm officially a Mexican!) and picked up a few more items. The service is personalized just like Instacart but of course, my Spanish is garbage so when they call I have no idea what they are saying. The delivery is very quick and easy. You just go online order your food and/or household products, set a time for delivery, and purchase! They bring your delivery in reusable bags that you just have to remember to give back at the next delivery. From what I've seen delivery is either $69 or $99 pesos (about $3.83-$5.50) depending on how much you order.

As you can see, I can probably survive on $50 per week. A lot of the items I bought, I can continually use so I didn't really spend much on groceries and household products. I also believe Walmart delivers (why else would they have meat on their web site) and another local store called Superama. I will try them out too.

You also have to remember that the food is fresh with no hormones and other additives. I will do a video on how different the chicken breasts I got look in comparison to any chicken breast I've ever gotten in the US. It just does not look the same because it's not pumped full of drugs. My fruit tastes like heaven and is so sweet and always fresh. There is no comparison!

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
