<strong>The prices.</strong> If you can make dollars and turn them into pesos the sky is the limit! I went out yesterday with a fellow traveler that came into town to explore Mexico City. I got two delicious hot dogs for $1.32, a large smoothie with freshly squeezed juice and fresh fruit for $2.37, a shot of liquor for $2.37, and another very large mixed alcoholic beverage for $4.68. I'll write another post on what food costs out here once I head to the grocery store.

<strong>The people.</strong> Everyone here is so polite and considerate. Except when they're driving! I have been met with nothing but kindness here.

<strong>The weather.</strong> It's always sunny and warm here. The weather never really changes. It does get cold at night though, but during the day it's between 70 and 78 degrees at most.

<strong>Transportation options.</strong> From <a href="https://www.uber.com/invite/elyser416ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uber</a>, to bikes, to subway, to buses...Mexico City has it all and it's very easy to get around and beyond affordable. Also if you want to go outside Mexico City, transportation within the country is so affordable too.

<strong>Uber Eats.</strong> I'm lazy sometimes...this has been a life saver for me! I'm out here working hard and can't get outside to go grab a bite to eat.

<strong>Luxury Living.</strong> I have a furnished apartment with essentials and right by a train and bus station. A weekly maid that cleans my apartment from top to bottom and washes my clothes. Internet, electricity, and water included. Handyman on site Mon-Sat which fixes things and takes my garbage out for me. I get driven as rides here are always under $5 per ride.

<strong>Entertainment.</strong> There is SO much to do! As you can see from my blog, I'm never bored. There are all kinds of things to do and see for free or ridiculously cheap. Plus, Mexico City is so big, it would take forever to see everything here.

<strong>Language.</strong> The language is so beautiful and easy to learn. It also has SO many advantages in being able to travel to four other continents.

<strong>Laid back.</strong> Everyone is so laid back and upbeat. The whole environment is positive. Even when I lived in the ghetto everyone seemed happy. I don't have to impress anyone...all I have to be is ME.

<strong>Food.</strong> Can't forget the food. My favorite food is so simple...flautas...but I love them to death. I also love a good glass of horchata. The food here is prepared fresh and cooked to order. You also get so much for what you pay. The fruits and vegetables here are fresh too. But, when I tire of Mexican food, there are all the US restaurants you can think of along with other cultures. I've had Nigerian and Indian food since I've been here.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
