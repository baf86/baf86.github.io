I've been interviewing for online positions so I can get US dollars instead of pesos AND have the freedom to work where and when I want. I had my first interview yesterday before my first espa√±ol class. I would be teaching ESL online. I believe my interview went well but we shall see. I have a few more coming up and I also found this app that doesn't pay nowhere near as much but it's another method to get my hustle on. #hustla

ü§ê <i><a href="https://baselang.com/signup/?referral=me%40elyserobinson.com" target="_blank">BaseLang</a> - The website I've been using to learn Spanish with unlimited lessons for $149 per month.</i><br>

I really, truly need to get on a schedule. I'm going to start waking up at 7am, exercising, showering, taking care of business, grab some breakfast, then head off to my classes. This is why I need to work before I get fat and ugly.

I didn't get to eat breakfast before I left yesterday and was starving throughout my spanish lessons. Yeaaaa I'll never do that again. I used Uber Pool for the first time by accident and was almost late for my lessons. I actually like Uber Pool and will use it all the time unless I have somewhere quick to go.

My spanish classes were real chill yesterday. I think my teacher is great. He's real patient and answers any questions we have thoroughly. Only thing I don't like is we're in small rooms and you can hear outside noise. I'll do my whole month and see what's going on after that. There's only me and white man in our group lessons. I didn't ask where he's from but he's kind of weird and curses in class. I need to find a spanish partner like yesterday to practice my spanish. I also need to turn the TV on in the background when I'm at home. One of my Uber drivers told me to listen to music as it helped him learn english easily. I going to get some Audible books too. Yea yea I know I should have BEEN done this. I've been going through things...

I had "linner" at this restaurant and it was delicious. I'm still wigging off how much food they give you. Here I am back in the states deciding if I can get a special drink instead of water or get an appetizer to go with my meal when all that is included here! This meal cost me $3.50.

I'm on the prowl for a spanish "tutor". I need to find an app like Tinder to find a senior or senorita to speak spanish with lol.

Anyhoo let me get off of here before I don't eat breakfast again!

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
