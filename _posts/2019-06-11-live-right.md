0:02  
Yeah, it's been a minute.

0:05  
I've been

0:05  
busy

0:06  
learning all kinds of new things every day,

0:10  
every single day. And so

0:13  
I really haven't wanted to blog or do videos or basically just do anything. So

0:22  
I got a few things to talk about. I'll talk

0:23  
about positive and negative things. Because

0:30  
positive about the negative, right.

0:32  
And so first things first, let's talk about these these these crazy men is crazy, man. So

0:41  
in previous podcast that I've had,

0:44  
I've shouted out a man by the name of uses,

üõ≥Ô∏è <i><a href="https://www.airfordable.com/referred?referrer=5a68bfc9535a390036c934f7" target="_blank">Airfordable</a> - Want to take a vacation but can't afford to pay for the whole flight right now? Check out Airfordable! Sign up with my link to get $25 off your first flight!</i><br>

0:47  
and

0:50  
we usually talk about business type things, but we get serious about, you know, life, life, things that go on in life. The last time I talked to him, we were talking about

1:02  
basically having children out of wedlock, and, you know, single parent, and, you know,

1:06  
things like that.

1:08  
And I've always enjoyed talking to him,

1:12  
because like, he's older than me, and I respect older people, because they have more knowledge than me, you know,

1:17  
and always learned something. So I'm

1:24  
never got off topic on you know, anything else, always business

‚õ±Ô∏è <i><a href="https://www.visahq.com/?a_aid=vaff9616" target="_blank">VisaHQ</a> - Help in obtaining your visa if needed</i><br>

1:28  
or Life Life things. And so,

1:31  
I have posted in a

1:34  
teaching group

1:35  
that, you know,

1:38  
one of these days trying to finish up

1:39  
my master's degree, I've been working on my master's degree since 2013.

1:46  
I can't believe it, it's almost been two and a half years.

1:52  
But you know, life happens and

üöë <i><a href="https://www.sevencorners.com/?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">Seven Corners</a> - Travel/Health insurance in case you get hurt, sick, or lose your luggage</i><br>

1:57  
whatever. So

2:01  
I transferred to Walden because Walden was given a free semester. So,

2:03  
I mean, I think a semester is like, three K, or something like that. And you can take as many classes as you want to, and go at your own pace. So I highly recommend Walden. I've been enjoying it so far. And so since they gave me that free semester, oh, like, shit, why not? She got to be able to take a right. Um, and so I've been, I've been doing that. And so I posted a teaching group that

2:33  
I love

2:34  
teaching adults, you know, I love giving out my life experience and, and I love teaching business

2:40  
courses, because, you know, I was an auditor in my, in my past life. And so

2:49  
teaching business courses, accounting, you know, Econ, things like that. And so a Masters would, you know, help me do that, and not

üõ¥ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=385121&mid=11018&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2598552&clickref=" target="_blank">Viator</a> - Get $10 free</i><br>

2:55  
that I wouldn't be able to teach business courses with without, with him. Without a master, sorry,

3:01  
my English has gotten the

3:05  
I'm, especially here in Mexico, or if I went to like China, or somewhere, I could definitely teach at a university and do that. But I want to, you know, make sure that I can teach online if I want to, or, you know,

3:18  
have more options for especially for more pay.

3:23  
And

3:26  
so I posted in there, you know, I'm working on my two, one or two year plan,

3:30  
because I don't see myself finishing within the next

üóø <i><a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/ee4bce1e-84de-4387-a735-d59d04539960" target="_blank">Groupon</a> - Have used this web site for YEARS to find all kinds of deals in multiple cities all over the world.</i><br>

3:34  
couple months, of course.

3:38  
And so he responds, I was like, you know, there's less opportunities in Brazil. And I'm like, okay, cool, now that I want to go to Brazil or anything, but

3:47  
you never know what the future holds.

3:51  
And he did tell me that in previous previous talks that we had,

3:55  
that was a good place

3:57  
for, you know, for people wanting to learn business.

‚öì <i><a href="https://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=1953880" target="_blank">Booking.com</a> - Get 20% off hotels</i><br>

4:01  
And so he messages me, and in we're talking innocent conversation, I'll

4:08  
even posted on my blog would

4:12  
the text message and so

4:13  
next thing I know, I said that? Yeah, I'm trying to keep we're talking about,

4:25  
about expenses, and income, income and expenses. And he's like, it's not how much you make is how much expenses is really. And I'm like, Yeah, that's true.

4:35  
Because if you can reduce your expenses, you have way more income. And so,

ü§ê <i><a href="https://baselang.com/signup/?referral=me%40elyserobinson.com" target="_blank">BaseLang</a> - The website I've been using to learn Spanish with unlimited lessons for $149 per month.</i><br>

4:40  
and I told him that, you know, I want to, of course, reduce my expenses, so I can have more money for spa days, facials, and massages thing I know, he's sending me some Kochi shit. I'm the woman that has come all over her damn face. And so I'm like, What the fuck? is this shit? You know? And I'm not expecting that at all from him, let alone a man and all. But

5:12  
what can you do as a woman? We go through so much so much on the daily

5:17  
from men.

5:20  
So

5:23  
that was that was a lie. And so he obviously doesn't know me.

5:29  
Because if he did, he would know that I routinely post things that men send me on my on my Facebook page.

5:40  
And so I post on my Facebook page, and he's he's pretty well known in the expat community. And so, somebody told me it went viral. So I don't I don't know.

5:52  
I don't really know. But

üíé <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=383744&mid=6288&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2587800&clickref=" target="_blank">Fiverr.com</a> - Need a website? fiverr | Need a voice over? fiverr | Need a logo? fiverr</i><br>

5:54  
there's a lot of people on my page commenting saying he's thick and nasty, and all kinds of things. And, you know, I could do a lot more damage. And I also posted in his little whatsapp group that

6:04  
that I was in and I just left it But yeah, I mean, manga learn to stop this thick shit. They're like, seriously going to learn? It's, it's just nasty. Like,

6:16  
would you do that to your mother? Yeah, they're probably really

6:20  
there's a lot of men that do she turned my mother basically hate their mother. And then they hate women

6:25  
fucking in sales and shit. But anyway,

6:29  
moving along, next topic is um,

6:36  
services you can get to your house

üìÜ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=379678&mid=5759&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2562126&clickref=" target="_blank">TrustedHousesitters</a> - Travel like a local for less. Exchange pet care for free accommodation.</i><br>

6:40  
like delivery personal trainer. And so I would love to have a personal trainer come to my house.

6:47  
So I asked and one of my expat groups like what do you have that comes to your house? And so I got some great responses to my show. say that, you know, we were bragging I'm like, Well, if you can't get this in your country, you need to move. I mean,

7:02  
this is one of the perks of

7:03  
being an expat like seriously. And so

7:09  
I have a housekeeper that comes here and cleans up my house once a week.

7:14  
And I pay her 300 pesos

7:15  
which is like $13 $13

7:21  
she has been work

üé† <i><a href="https://skiplagged.com/r/elyser" target="_blank">Skiplagged</a> - Exposing loopholes in airfare pricing to save you money.</i><br>

7:23  
she I'm always those pair 250 pesos but I pay your 300 pesos is she's she's a nice woman I practice my Spanish with her so

7:34  
you know and I usually don't have changed anyways they don't have they don't have change like that. So

7:40  
when I go to the bank they don't use the give me 5050 pesos

7:42  
they gave me 201

7:43  
hundred pesos so

7:47  
I just get rid of 380 is not going to kill me it's like an extra two $3 so yeah

üõ≥Ô∏è <i><a href="https://www.airfordable.com/referred?referrer=5a68bfc9535a390036c934f7" target="_blank">Airfordable</a> - Want to take a vacation but can't afford to pay for the whole flight right now? Check out Airfordable! Sign up with my link to get $25 off your first flight!</i><br>

7:56  
she goes airplanes my house and everything and you know

8:00  
kind of sorry for because I don't it's like always high in my living room. You know,

8:04  
and I turn turn the air conditioner for the

8:07  
cooler down in there but I can only do so much because she'd be sweating when she ain't here but

8:14  
I want a personal trainer. I'm also have grocery delivery. They have a whole app that I can basically get whatever I want if I wanted to get a butter finger at 10 o'clock at night I can have somebody to go get me a Butterfinger at 10 o'clock at night as long as the stores open

8:35  
so yeah other things people said hairstylist Manny petty

‚õ±Ô∏è <i><a href="https://www.visahq.com/?a_aid=vaff9616" target="_blank">VisaHQ</a> - Help in obtaining your visa if needed</i><br>

8:42  
massage therapist.

8:46  
Yeah barber

8:48  
personal trainer of course.

8:49  
Language tutor that's a good one.

8:54  
I actually should find me a language tutor to kind of my house

8:56  
I need some move because

8:58  
like I said we'll be having another McCain going my livery

9:04  
don't even have a fan and they're crazy.

9:08  
Um Oh, somebody said they have gas delivered

üöë <i><a href="https://www.sevencorners.com/?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">Seven Corners</a> - Travel/Health insurance in case you get hurt, sick, or lose your luggage</i><br>

9:11  
to their house like gas. Like are you serious?

9:17  
Like that is so crazy.

9:18  
Doctor, you can get the doctor to come to your house nobody said doctor but

9:24  
you

9:24  
can definitely get the doctor to come to your house because I've seen it before.

9:27  
Um

9:32  
I should I should have just got out the list. I wasn't even thinking before I did my my podcast but

9:38  
you hear whatever you want to come to the house. And these other countries we

9:43  
still call shithole

9:44  
countries. And it's a beautiful, amazing thing.

üõ¥ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=385121&mid=11018&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2598552&clickref=" target="_blank">Viator</a> - Get $10 free</i><br>

9:50  
And so now that every time I'm out and I see something interesting to me

9:57  
go inside ask for card ask me you know they come to my house. And you know because I'm always trying to find something to where it makes

10:07  
my life so much easier.

10:10  
And so like the other day I have went and spa place. I won't call it a spa I guess it would be like

10:19  
like a

10:21  
waxing place or something like that.

10:23  
And so

10:25  
she's like I give you a free 30 minute facial now

üóø <i><a href="https://www.groupon.com/visitor_referral/h/ee4bce1e-84de-4387-a735-d59d04539960" target="_blank">Groupon</a> - Have used this web site for YEARS to find all kinds of deals in multiple cities all over the world.</i><br>

10:28  
I don't know if they actually give out 30 minute facials or she just wanted to touch my black

10:32  
skin.

10:34  
Because you know the difference like tries to know the difference.

10:40  
I got a 30 minute facial she's

10:41  
all like I can give me a discount and this how much is going to be so the facial comes out I got four

10:46  
facials they come out to about $22 apiece. I might get more facials because they're actually having a 50% off special right now after

‚öì <i><a href="https://www.booking.com/index.html?aid=1953880" target="_blank">Booking.com</a> - Get 20% off hotels</i><br>

10:54  
I got the low first special

10:56  
that she gave me.

10:59  
Anyway so I did get the

11:01  
massage specials I got 10 massages for

11:07  
$15 apiece.

11:08  
And so because they have a 50% off

11:11  
special

11:13  
so $15 apiece for I can get a relaxing or deep tissue massage and so I'll probably mix them up for 10 massages what is bad I lasted about two and a half months I used to go like once a week. So I'm like in love right the street

11:29  
I can just walk today. So

ü§ê <i><a href="https://baselang.com/signup/?referral=me%40elyserobinson.com" target="_blank">BaseLang</a> - The website I've been using to learn Spanish with unlimited lessons for $149 per month.</i><br>

11:33  
yeah,

11:34  
shithole countries

11:37  
were not even talking about you can have your own personal driver. I believe one of my piece of Mexico City paid their driver $300 a month

11:46  
for driving. And then of course you have Uber i mean i click on Uber

11:54  
and Uber's out there in less than five minutes

11:57  
so

12:00  
no no taking the bus no having a walk get your own little personal driver

12:03  
so fast that I'm updates on

12:10  
me.

üíé <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=383744&mid=6288&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2587800&clickref=" target="_blank">Fiverr.com</a> - Need a website? fiverr | Need a voice over? fiverr | Need a logo? fiverr</i><br>

12:12  
I just been out here trying to pitch my business. I'm

12:16  
doing tons and tons of research. Like I said, I've been

12:21  
learning all kinds of new things.

12:27  
Trying to get this passive income going so

12:29  
I'll have more time to focus

12:30  
on whatever I want to focus.

12:35  
And so I haven't heard anything back if they don't, if they don't contact me by Monday I'm going to email them again but

12:46  
I go on a pitch for organization and France.

12:50  
They will help me move there. Give me money to move there give me money for my business and coach me on growing my business and I'm so excited about that. But wish Wish me luck.

13:05  
I don't want to leave Mexico Mexico is home I love the fuck out of Mexico. But

13:13  
scared money don't make money and so I'll do anything to grow my business and for me to be successful

13:22

She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
