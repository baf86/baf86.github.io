Been a minute...I've been trying to run my business and get everything situated for that. I go back "home" on Saturday to visit my nephew for his birthday and to pick up a few things I desire. Also to handle a few things for my business.

Went to the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/mx/radisson-paraiso.en.html?aid=1953880&no_rooms=1&group_adults=2" target="_blank">Radisson Paraiso Perisur</a> here in Mexico City to get a reflexology session, massage, facial, and sauna treatment. They didn't have a pool or jacuzzi so I don't know what kind of "spa" they have. I wanted to sit out by the pool and chill for a few hours. I did enjoy my massage and facial though. I need to get back to getting those every week as I did in the states. I wish the lady didn't work at a hotel as she was great. Looking for cheap, cheap and good. I'll be on the hunt when I move into my new apartment next week.

I had "breakfast" which was lunch time because I didn't eat before I left as I was rushed. I had bean soup, steak, rice, and vegetables. $13.50+tip. It was delicious.

I also visited the local Walmart in my area. It looked old and small. I'm going to visit another in the area to compare. Found a few things I need in it though. I'm so used to gigantic stores back home...these stores are like a Circle K in comparison.

I sat here all morning trying to plan out a trip to Cancun when I come back but I realized I haven't even explored Mexico City! I have a food and market tour for Friday I'm going to do. I've also learned I need to print out my vouchers. I'm so used handing over my phone for tickets so I need to get a printer as soon as I get back.

I've been cooped up in my apartment trying to get my business together among other things in my life. I'm hoping this time I don't feel sick. I've been having terrible migraines lately.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to MÃ©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of MÃ©xico City nor even visited MÃ©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in MÃ©xico and she is there to stay!
