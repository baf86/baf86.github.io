Sooo I had a "date" about a week and a half ago. My first one in Mexico City. No, he wasn't Mexican and yes he was a US citizen. People contact me all the time to meet up and this is the first guy I've entertained.

We were talking back and forth on Facebook messenger which is fine but it would have been faster if we talked on the phone or even sent voice messages back and forth. This was annoying.

He arrives but I'm a busy woman so couldn't meet up with him earlier in the day. I had a lunch date with un amigo that lives here. I had a meeting later that night so couldn't meet then either. We're still going back and forth on messenger and by this time it's about 11pm at night. He's trying to get me to come out so I'm like ok, I'm bored, I took a nap earlier I'll be fine AND he's taking me to one of my favorite restaurants so I obliged.

I'm ready in 30 minutes (as usual) and he seems to take damn near an hour. I don't know why when all he was wearing was a t-shirt and some jeans. Anyhoo...I arrive at the restaurant before him and he gets lost. In Mexico City, you have to put the neighborhood of the place you're going to or it could be 30 different places. It's fine and I wait. He doesn't arrive until almost 1am.

We greet each other with a hug and I accidentally step on his shoes with my big clumsy feet. Great first impression...plus I hate hugs from strangers anyway. Guess I need to practice hugging.

We order, eat, and talk for the next almost two hours. Seemed like everything was going well with good conversation. Around 2:45am I'm starting to get sleepy and the place closed at 2am anyway so I said let's go and said good bye. I texted him telling him I made it back home with no response. I'm like ok...what man doesn't see if a woman made it home safely? Some man.

I got a weird vibe from him and my vibes are always right plus his voice I was not expecting to be so unmanly. He made out like we were going to meet up the next day to show him around Mexico City but he never said anything. Funny thing is he kept messaging me. After I figured out this was going nowhere I quit responding. His messages will be forever unread.

My first date in Mexico...stay tuned for my second "planned" date in Mexico and how that turned out. This is why I've given up dating. I'm focused on me, myself, I, and saving up for my projects. I jokingly tell folks...he will have to have angel wings on and fall in my lap...SO I'll be looking for him around Halloween time.

Until next time...

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to MÃ©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of MÃ©xico City nor even visited MÃ©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in MÃ©xico and she is there to stay!
