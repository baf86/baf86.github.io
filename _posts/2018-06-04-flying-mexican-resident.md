Back home and I was so excited! In Mexico, they have two lines for "Foreigners" and "Mexicans" when coming through customs and immigration. Guess what line I got to use last night? The Mexican line! I'm so happy I don't have to stand in the "Foreigners" line anymore as that line can get really long and wait time can be over an hour. Plus I'm always flying with my dog which can become tiresome.

If you have ever been to Mexico, then you know you receive a "Tourist Card" on arrival where you have to fill out where you're going, why you're there, flight information, where you'll be staying and a few other things. You STILL have to fill that out as a resident. I thought that part of my life would get easier. You also cannot lose this card or you'll be paying a fine. So, as a resident, I still have to keep track of this little piece of paper. When you arrive back in Mexico, you have to hand that piece of paper back over all filled out to customs.

I thought I had filled everything out but didn't so had to get out of line and go back. They also still stamp your passport which makes me mad too. Just filling up my passport for no reason. Next time I'll see if I can get them NOT to stamp it.

All in all, becoming a permanent resident DOES NOT cut down on the paperwork you have to do when entering and exiting BUT you do get to use the Mexican line.

Stay tuned...after this BeAForeigner.com Giveaway I'll be having two more...

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
