I have to pack essential medicines that I may need. So far I have:<br>

ü§ê <i><a href="https://baselang.com/signup/?referral=me%40elyserobinson.com" target="_blank">BaseLang</a> - The website I've been using to learn Spanish with unlimited lessons for $149 per month.</i><br>

-Asthma pump - pretty much essential or I could die<br>
-Aspirin - take a few pills just in case<br>
-Ibuprofen - different than aspirin so I'll take a few pills<br>
-Pepto Bismal - never know when you'll need it a foreign land BUT I was just fine in China<br>
-Imodium - ditto for this too<br>
-Allergy Medicine - I had terrible allergies in Houston plus I have ear problems on the plane<br>
-<a href="https://amzn.to/2JzU8Oc" target="_blank">Lena Cup</a> - for women and your period so need for pads. I HIGHLY recommend this. I was on my period in Hawaii and I wanted to snorkel and zipline without worrying about a pad. I ran around with this baby all day and didn't feel a thing.<br>
-Mini Pads - taking a few for before and after my period<br>
-<a href="https://amzn.to/2FroEEo" target="_blank">Emergen C</a> - taking a few packets so I can get acclimated to the environment quicker

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
