I've been learning a lot! I'm thoroughly enjoying my classes. The white guy is weird. He questions EVERYTHING in class and I'm just like learn it or don't! We had a few lunch dates together which was cool. But I enjoy eating by myself lol.

I found an audiobook from Audible.com to help with my espanol. I would like to get the alphabet and numbers down. The audiobook also has key phrases you would use in most situations. I haven't really tested it out to know how effective it is, but I'll let you know.

I've been using Uber to get back and forth to class everyday. I need to quit being lazy and take public transportation but I'm spoiled now. Not being on a stinky, crowded bus/train everyday reduces my anxiety and stress so I will continue to do it. But yesterday I don't know if the guy was stereotyping Black folks or what. He asked me if I could sing and I didn't think anything of it. Not until someone on one of the Facebook groups I frequent said something about being asked that all the time when in different countries. I just told him no and left it at that.

I got my first rain today. It's currently raining with huge drops. I'm glad I have nothing hanging up to dry, just some clothes soaking. My neighbors have a comforter hanging up I feel sorry for them.

I've been on the prowl for a Spanish partner. I've tried Plenty of Fish with pretty much no luck. Although there's a Nigerian guy that wants to meet me. I told him I'll meet him Sunday I guess. He's a teacher and been here 4 years but yet isn't fluent in Spanish. So we'll see how that goes. I'm invisible here just as in the states...don't know if that's good or bad. Should I try a club? lol

I plan to do a free walking tour on Sunday which is all in Spanish. I probably won't understand a thing but immersion is the only way to learn. I'll definitely post pics.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
