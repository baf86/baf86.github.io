I received my visa yesterday. I highly recommend <a href="https://www.mychinavisa.com">China Visa Service Center</a>. They helped me over the phone very quickly and easily when I had questions about the Visa Form. Total fee for regular service was $128 which I mailed off 8/10 and received back 8/18 to their San Francisco office. I believe this is fair to not have to drive back and forth to San Francisco twice to pick up my passport. It can take 3+ hours to drive a little over 100 miles to the Bay area and that's not including tolls and parking.

I guess I'm ready to go. I'm constipated, pausing, hungry, have migraines, anxious, excited, happy, scared, and worried.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M&eacute;xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M&eacute;xico City nor even visited M&eacute;xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M&eacute;xico and she is there to stay!
