I'll repeat over and over that there are all kinds of opportunities here...from starting your own business to working for a large multinational. A lot of jobs you MUST speak Spanish but there are tons of international companies here that are looking for English speakers only. I still suggest finding work in dollars and converting them to pesos though. That would allow you to have the most financial freedom and to live the easiest and best life here in Mexico.

<strong>A long list of companies where you may find work include:</strong><br>
3M<br>
World Health Organization<br>
Rackspace<br>
Nokia<br>
Emerson<br>
Huawei Technologies<br>
Ingersoll Rand<br>
Marriott International<br>
Oracle<br>
Google<br>
Red Hat<br>
Honeywell<br>
Alcatel<br>
Fox Networks Group<br>
Michael Page<br>
Medline Industries<br>
Uber<br>

The tricky part is getting a company to sponsor your work visa. A country will always want to hire a local candidate instead of going through the hassle of dealing with the government and tons of paperwork. I know people here that have gotten sponsored though so it is possible if the company really wants you.

<strong>Of course, I have to shout out my business, <a href="https://www.beaforeigner.com" target="_blank">BeAForeigner.com</a>, where I have a daily list of opportunities to move overseas.</strong>

I also highly recommend teaching English online. They hire VERY quickly and as long as you have a strong internet connection you can work ANYWHERE. Please also reference my other <a href="https://elyserobinson.com/broke" target="_blank">How to Live overseas Without Going Broke</a> for more ideas on how to make a living overseas.

And I'm going to repeat...Mexico City is an AMAZING place to live! Wish I had moved here years ago.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
