<img src="/img/welcome.jpeg" width="300" height="300" alt="Welcome to Elyse Y. Robinson's Blog">

Welcome to <strong>my blog</strong>! The story of one Black woman's adventures in M&eacute;xico...or wherever I am at the moment. I decided to start this blog to be an inspiration to others who want to live overseas. This is where I write about my day to day activities on living overseas in M&eacute;xico and any tips and tricks I've found to help make your transition to living overseas easier. I LOVE to break the stereotype of ‚ÄúBlack folks don‚Äôt do this or that‚Äù‚Ä¶ I also want to paint M&eacute;xico in a great light. It's such a beautiful and great place that I fell deeply in love with the country. <strong>M&eacute;xico City changed my <em>life</em>...I mourned the loss of my mother and healed my soul here. M&eacute;xico will always have a special place in my heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è</strong>

<em>We all have knowledge about how the world works. But when someone like me comes along and challenges that knowledge, we do not know how to handle it. We are not hardwired that way. It is difficult to question everything you have ever thought to be true. It‚Äôs not your fault. You can believe me or not, but whichever you choose, you are the one who has to deal with the consequences. So make your decision wisely!</em>

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M&eacute;xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M&eacute;xico City nor even visited M&eacute;xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M&eacute;xico and she is there to stay!
