Forgot to share this story...

I'm coming back home through Mexico City airport and I put my dildo in my backpack because you know that's important and I wouldn't DARE put it in checked luggage just in case my luggage got lost. It's an important staple of life!

I go through security and my backpack goes through the x-ray machine. The security guard woman grabs my bag and set it to the side of course.

Security guard woman digs through my bag and asks what's this!?! I look around quickly and say "a dildo".

A lady next to me in line busts out laughing. The security guard woman's whole face changes. Then she has the nerve to take it out of my bag and run it through the x-ray machine!

It's small and kinda looks like the picture below. üòÇ

I'm like sigh...

Crazy shit is always happening to me. üòÇü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
