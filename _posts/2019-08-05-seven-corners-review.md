<strong>Would you be able to pay for a serious medical emergency?</strong> Even though I have "free" health care in Mexico, I would rather pay out of pocket and visit whatever medical provider I want. My whole reason for being in Merida is to focus on my business and get my health together. Little did I know I'd need a <a href="https://elyserobinson.com/dental-care" target="_blank">root canal</a> and I opted to get my tooth pulled instead.

Right before I went, I bought <a href="https://www.sevencorners.com?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">Seven Corners Liaison Travel</a> to reimburse me for the cost of the dental care. The plan has already paid for itself as I was reimbursed $195.60.

I forget about petty things like the asthma pump I paid under $3...I can get that reimbursed too.

Here is what I have (more detail on what is covered <a href="https://www.sevencorners.com?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">HERE</a>)

Deductible: $0
Medical Maximum: $50,000
Hazardous Activities: Selected
Does your trip include the USA?: No
Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&amp;D) - per Occ ($): $10,000
Emergency Medical Evacuation &amp; Repatriation: $250,000 (separate from the Medical Maximum)
Extension of Benefits to Home Country: $5,000
Return of Mortal Remains - per Policy Period: $25,000

My next renewal will be from September 1st - December 31st for $155.18 (Plan Cost + Renewal Fee). So about $52 a month for coverage.

I'm satisfied so far with <a href="https://www.sevencorners.com?a=7EA9D670-6805-4F0F-AB1C-804BD2C35B7D&z=HGP2SEQ" target="_blank">Seven Corners Liaison Travel</a>.

It did take a while for them to process my claim though. I submitted it on 06/02/2019 through email with the form and all my receipts, and the payment was in my account on 07/17/2019. So a little over a month. I don't like that they did not confirm receipt of my claim and there is no way to track your claim. I did receive an email saying my claim was processed but it doesn't have any other information attached to it. Is it denied? Is it approved? A breakdown? I had to call and ask.

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M√©xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M√©xico City nor even visited M√©xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M√©xico and she is there to stay!
