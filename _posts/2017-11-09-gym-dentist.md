FINALLY walked over to the gym the other day to see what they offer. Price is $595 pesos ($31) a month, or you can do quarterly or yearly for a little cheaper. Price includes unlimited classes, training, and access to any part of the gym.

I've been having pain in my back right tooth. I know these resin fillings never last long for me. I've begged for silver but no one wants to put them in my head. I received a recommendation from a woman I met and went there. Very nice people and the dentist spoke great english. Cost for the consultation $200 and x-rays $200. Bacteria from my filling being half missing has caused inflamation and I need a laser treatment for $10,000 pesos and I have to get the fillings replaced for another $1,200 each (3 fillings), and then he said I should get an occlusal guard for another $1,500. Total price $794 dollars. Pricing in the states for all this work is thousands of dollars.

I go back tomorrow to start my dental work. Wish me luck and no pain!

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to México City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of México City nor even visited México before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in México and she is there to stay!
