My name is Elyse Y. Robinson and I am born and raised in sunny Sacramento, California. I lived there until I was 22 years old and moved to Boston for my first federal job. Throughout my years as a federal employee, I have lived in San Diego, Los Angeles, and Tucson, Arizona. I have a degree in accounting and worked as an Auditor for a few years prior to my move overseas.<br>

I am now 33 years old and living permanently in M√©xico or until further notice üòä. I know tons of Spanish and I‚Äôm getting better every day with practice. I am self-employed and own <a href="https://beaforeigner.com" target="_blank">BeAForeigner Inc.</a><br>

<strong>Why did you move to M√©xico City?</strong><br>
The answer is below. I left a few days after my <a href="https://elyserobinson.com/my-mother" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mother's funeral</a>. You can also read this <a href="https://elyserobinson.com/fleeing">post</a> I wrote too for a bit more information.<br>

<strong>What made you choose M√©xico City?</strong><br>
<em>Truth be told.</em> After coming back from China, I realized I only knew english and how much of a handicap that was. Wasn't going back to China after my mother passed away because I was just too vulnerable and needed my family and they needed me. I also wanted the option to fly back and forth quickly and cheaply. So I thought I should learn Spanish...one of the most spoken languages in the world.<br>

I was originally supposed to go to Ecuador and me being selfish again was to leave while my mother was still alive. But of course, He laughs at your plans. My mother passed away the day before I was to leave for Ecuador. Funny because she did not want me to go at all. I couldn't afford another ticket as that wasn't in my budget. I also wasn't waiting around for the refund from United as that took months. I had to wait for the death certificate to get the refund.<br>

‚õ±Ô∏è <i><a href="https://www.visahq.com/?a_aid=vaff9616" target="_blank">VisaHQ</a> - Help in obtaining your visa if needed</i><br>

So, I had thousands of Southwest ‚úàÔ∏è points and I knew they went to Spanish speaking countries (M√©xico, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic). I looked and saw that flying to M√©xico City used the least amount of points and was only 1.5 hours away from Houston by plane on a direct flight. M√©xico speaks Spanish right? Funny as I've lived on the border twice (San Diego, Tucson) and never stepped foot in M√©xico. All I heard was bad stories! I was also overwhelmed at the border in San Diego when I had to go there to obtain my <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/sentri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SENTRI</a> card. Little did I know that I would end up loving this place.<br>

Can you believe I never heard of M√©xico City before I bought my plane ticket? I bought my plane ticket. I found a place to live through <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/elyser93?currency=USD" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> and found a language school. My first <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/elyser93?currency=USD" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> rental was in the ghetto and not close to any major attractions or public transportation so that's why I ended up leaving a month and a half in. BUT I chose it because the reviews for the host were phenomenal. She took me around the neighborhood, showed me how to use the public transportation system üöå, and just gave me the confidence to go out and explore.<br>

In closing, I took all my savings and came out here on a hope and dream. I HAD to make it work. I'll be here 3 years as of November 2019 and can't believe it one bit!<br>

<strong>How did you move to M√©xico City?</strong><br>
See the answer above.<br>

<strong>How is living in M√©xico City?</strong><br>
I love it here or I would have left right? How can I describe M√©xico City? It's like Los Angeles or New York or San Francisco. It's like living there but without all the negativity of race issues and knowing you are Black everywhere you go. Here I feel free.<br>

üõ¥ <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=385121&mid=11018&awinaffid=323811&linkid=2598552&clickref=" target="_blank">Viator</a> - Get $10 free</i><br>

M√©xico City has everything you can think of. From museums to schools, to shows (ballet, wrestling, bullfighting), to restaurants, to daily free events, you name it M√©xico City has it. The weather is usually great. There is a rainy season from about May to September and it storms at night for a few minutes and clears up. I love it though and listen to the thunder. Yes, it does get cold at night so I compare the weather to living in California. Nice during the day, but cold in the morning and night. M√©xico City is not near a beach!!! It is surrounded by mountains which makes it even more beautiful. It's very diverse too...I've met people from all over the world. I honestly can't think of a con of living here.<br>

<a href="https://elyserobinson.com/living-expenses">Here were my monthly expenses for M√©xico City.</a><br>

<strong>Do you feel safe there?</strong><br>
M√©xico City is one of the largest cities in the world! Like any big city, you have to know where not to go and practice precautionary measures. Crime can happen anywhere. But I feel safer here than the states just because of the race issues back home. I've never felt unsafe at all and people are helpful and friendly here.<br>

<strong>How are you treated there?</strong><br>
Like a Queen üëë! I've gotten free things just for being Black. When you walk in the door everyone wants to help you and talk to you. I'm treated with respect and people are SO patient with me since sometimes my Spanish doesn't flow easily. You are also treated like a woman here. I've had men go out of their way to help me. I've never felt discriminated against here.<br>

<strong>What does your housing look like?</strong><br>
My studio apartment is furnished with essentials and right by a major train and bus station. A weekly housekeeper that cleans my apartment from top to bottom and washes my clothes. Internet, electricity, and water included. Handyman on-site Mon-Sat which fixes things and takes my garbage out for me. I scaled down A LOT but my life is better. I can always move into something bigger later. Check out the video I made:<br>

<strong>How do you get around?</strong><br>
There is <a href="https://www.uber.com/invite/elyser416ui" target="_blank">Uber</a> here (and another company called Cabify and a few others) which is very cheap compared to the US. They also have taxis everywhere. I don't think I've spent over $10 for an hour ride and 15 km. There is also a very extensive public transportation system here with buses and subways. Taking the bus and train is very cheap here. 6.50 pesos for the bus and 6 pesos for the train and as long as you don't leave the loading areas for both you can ride it with many transfers for that price.<br>

<strong>Do you speak Spanish?</strong><br>
I do now! I studied for 3 months in Guatemala and continue to study every day.<br>

<strong>How hard is it to live there without knowing Spanish?</strong><br>
Actually not hard at all. Some people never learn it at all! You know how people come to the US and never learn english. A lot of people know enough english to understand what you are saying. Make sure you speak proper english and don't use slang and idioms. If someone doesn't know english, they will find someone that does for you! I have to tell people all the time tell me in Spanish and do not speak english to me! They want to practice their english. üò°<br>

<strong>What did you do before you moved to M√©xico City?</strong><br>
I was an Auditor for the US Federal Government. The last place I "officially" worked was for the Air Force in Tucson, AZ. I had a good life but knew I wanted to leave the US eventually so had been working on that plan. But so much for my plan...but things do just line up when it's time.<br>

Yes, I have a degree in accounting and I'll probably never use it again. But that's a story for another day...üòù<br>

<strong>How do you make a living in M√©xico?</strong><br>
<a href="https://beaforeigner.com" target="_blank">BeAForeigner Inc.</a> where I help people move overseas through Worforce Transformation.<br>

Check out my post on <a href="https://elyserobinson.com/broke">financing your life overseas</a>.<br>

<strong>Why do Mexicans want to come to the US?</strong><br>
I actually get this one a lot. I can't answer this question definitely. I think the media portrays a lot of negativity that just isn't true (right along with the terrible image of M√©xico). Yes, it's true that some come for a better life because their lives were harder in M√©xico. It's also true that many come for a change of life too just like I did here in M√©xico City. I'll just leave it at that.<br>

<strong>Where can I take great Spanish lessons?</strong><br>
I highly recommend <a href="https://www.spanishacademyantiguena.com/" target="_blank">Antiguena Spanish Academy</a> in Guatemala. I did a 3 month homestay in Antigua with a private teacher. You can look around my site for the adventures I had in Guatemala.<br>

<div style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold">UPDATE: 10/19/2017</div>
<strong>How much money did you bring to M√©xico City?</strong><br>
Eh give or take about $10,000 I had saved up. That lasted me about 6 months and I honestly was overspending on things since I was so excited and everything was new to me. I had to do all the "touristy things". I probably could have gone a year. No regrets.<br>

<strong>What about the visa process?</strong><br>
One reason why I chose M√©xico was the easy visa process. You can come on a tourist visa for 6 months, leave and come back for another 6 months, rinse and repeat. The resident visa process is also simple. Go to your local consulate website for more information.<br>

<div style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold">UPDATE: 10/23/2017</div>
<strong>How long have you been in M√©xico City?</strong><br>
Going into my 4th year. Can't believe it...it just flew by. I arrived on November 26, 2016.<br>

<div style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold">UPDATE: 05/15/2018</div>
<strong>Are you a permanent resident?</strong><br>
I am NOT a citizen. I AM a permanent resident which is called a "Green Card" back in the states.<br>

Without a plan, Elyse Y. Robinson moved to M&eacute;xico City after her mother passed away from blood cancer on November 11, 2016. She never heard of M&eacute;xico City nor even visited M&eacute;xico before. She just knew she had to escape America to mourn. She had quit her whole life to help her family anyway. She had nothing more to lose. She is going into her fourth year in M&eacute;xico and she is there to stay!
